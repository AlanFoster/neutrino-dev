You can use Neutrino within your project, preferably using\nscripts defined in your project's package.json.\nSetup\nAfter completing the installation of Neutrino and your Neutrino preset, you will\nwant to define some scripts in your project's package.json in order to more simply build your project.\nIn a typical project:\n\nscripts.start would be the command you wish to run during development\nscripts.build would be the command you wish to run to create a production bundle\nscripts.test would be the command you wish to run to execute tests\n\nUsing these script targets may not be suitable for every project. They are only the\ntypical recommendations for script target names. You may choose any different name if desired\nfor your project.\nBuilding for development\nNeutrino provides the command neutrino start for creating a bundle during development. Using\nneutrino start by default sets the Node.js environment to development using the NODE_ENV environment variable,\nwhich is available in your project source code. Depending on the presets you are using, neutrino start\nmay also spin up a development server with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) capabilities.\nCheck the documentation of your preset for details.\nUsage:\n# PRESET_MODULE is the name of the preset to build with, e.g. @neutrinojs/react\nneutrino start --use PRESET_MODULE\n\nPutting this into your package.json will allow you to build your project using either\nyarn start or npm start. Using @neutrinojs/react as an example:\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"start\": \"neutrino start --use @neutrinojs/react\"\n  }\n}\n\nBuilding for production\nNeutrino provides the command neutrino build for creating a bundle for production deployment.\nUsing neutrino build by default sets the Node.js environment to production using the NODE_ENV environment variable,\nwhich is available in your project source code. See the documentation for your preset for details regarding additional\nsteps after your build is completed.\n# PRESET_MODULE is the name of the preset to build with, e.g. @neutrinojs/react\nneutrino build --use PRESET_MODULE\n\nPutting this into your package.json will allow you to build your project using either\nyarn build or npm run build. Using @neutrinojs/react as an example:\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"build\": \"neutrino build --use @neutrinojs/react\"\n  }\n}\n\nBuilding and running tests\nNeutrino provides the command neutrino test for invoking a set of tests included in your project.\nUsing neutrino test by default sets the Node.js environment variable to test using the NODE_ENV environment\nvariable, which is available in your project source code. How your source code is built and consumed from tests\nis determined by the middleware you are using. Running suites that are built the same as source files is encouraged by\nusing Neutrino-compatible middleware. Neutrino currently provides three core testing presets: Karma, Jest, and Mocha.\n# PRESET_MODULE is the name of the preset to build with, e.g. @neutrinojs/react\n# TESTING_MODULE is the name of another middleware to build with, e.g. @neutrinojs/karma\nneutrino test --use PRESET_MODULE TESTING_MODULE\n\nPutting this into your package.json will allow you to test your project using either\nyarn test or npm test. Using @neutrinojs/react and @neutrinojs/karma as an example:\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"test\": \"neutrino test --use @neutrinojs/react @neutrinojs/karma\"\n  }\n}\n\nUsing the command neutrino test will execute every test file located in your\ntesting directory. You may also provide to this command the specific test files you wish\nto run individually. It is important to note that when combined with the --use parameter, you should use two\ndashes after the last middleware to denote the end of the middleware and the beginning of the test files.\nneutrino test --use PRESET_A PRESET_B -- a_test.js b_test.js\n\nUsing multiple presets\nAll Neutrino commands support the --use command line parameter, but having to specify this for each script target\ncan be cumbersome and verbose, especially if you have many middleware or presets. Fortunately, Neutrino also supports\nspecifying presets using the use property in a .neutrinorc.js file. By omitting the --use\nflag and specifying a use array, every call to a Neutrino command will look up which middleware\nare configured in your in .neutrinorc.js.\nThis is the recommended approach when using more than one preset/middleware.\n// package.json\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"start\": \"neutrino start\",\n    \"build\": \"neutrino build\",\n    \"test\": \"neutrino test\"\n  }\n}\n\n// .neutrinorc.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  use: [\n    '@neutrinojs/react',\n    '@neutrinojs/karma'\n  ]\n}\n\n"},"project-layout.html":{"url":"project-layout.html","title":"Project Layout","keywords":"","body":"Project Layout\nOut of the box, Neutrino presets expect a project to have a particular structure to make the\ndevelopment process for new projects as quick as possible.

See\nCustom Configuration for detailed instructions.\nSource Code\nBy default, Neutrino presets expect all project source code to live in a directory named src in the\nroot of the project. This includes compiled and imported JavaScript files, CSS stylesheets, images, and any other assets\nthat would be available to your compiled project.\nWhen running your project or creating a build bundle, a preset will look for this src directory for\nthe main entry points of your application and use this as the relative location for finding other assets\nnecessary for creating your builds.\nBuild Assets\nWhen creating a build bundle, a preset will put the compiled assets, including any generated\nJavaScript files, into a directory named build by default. Typically your Neutrino preset will copy\nany files from the static directory over to the build directory, allowing you to maintain\nthe same relative path structure for static assets as is used for the source files.\nNormally most projects will exclude checking in this build directory to source control.\nBe sure to add this directory to your project's .gitignore, .hgignore, or similar file.\nTesting\nNeutrino presets by default expect all tests to be located in a directory named test. In order to make the\nseparation between tests and test fixtures or harnesses easier to differentiate, Neutrino presets also\nusually look for test files ending in _test.js or .test.js. See your specific test preset for more\ndetailed information about running tests and other conventions.\n"},"FAQ.html":{"url":"FAQ.html","title":"FAQ","keywords":"","body":"FAQ\nWhy not a boilerplate or alternative?\nBoilerplates are great resources for scaffolding out application-specific code which\nwould be difficult or tedious to generate for every project. Unfortunately many projects\nalso bake in build configuration into this process, causing a lot of duplication. If you\nneed to make a change to your build steps, you are forced to make that change across all\nyour similar projects. Using a preset rather than a boilerplate keeps this process DRY.\nTools like Create React App have\nbeen fantastic improvements to the tooling ecosystem, but unfortunately only work on specific\nenvironments like React, and do not allow simple extensibility of the build configuration. To\nanswer this, new and similar projects are cropping up to build different types of projects,\noften duplicating efforts which miss out on the best practices to share with the other project\ntypes.\nWhat is the added value versus all the boilerplate projects out there?\nThe proliferation of boilerplate and meta-packages is one thing we are trying to reduce. These types of projects \nare great, and do serve a purpose. But what if you wanted to make a configuration change across all your\nprojects? You must make config changes in many places, including the original boilerplate, whereas presets\ngive you the power to confine these changes to a single package. Some of these projects also make a trade-off\nbetween ease of set up and black-boxing the configuration. Once you decide to make a configuration change,\nyou are forced to maintain the entire configuration and its dependencies in perpetuity. We believe Neutrino\nrepresents a good balance between ease of set up and future extensibility.\nWhy don't presets use a normal webpack configuration object instead of the chaining API?\nThe webpack configuration works well when it is embedded into a single project, and it is the only configuration\nfile to maintain. Once the configuration is no longer co-located with the project, and needs to be extended or\nmodified across different projects, it becomes very messy to make those modifications.\nFor example, let's say that a preset instead used the webpack object configuration and added an instance of the\nEnvironmentPlugin:\nconfig.plugins.push(new webpack.EnvironmentPlugin(['NODE_ENV']));\n\nIf you wanted to extend this plugin in your own project to add more environment variables, you would most likely\nresort to either adding a new instance of the EnvironmentPlugin by requiring webpack yourself, or looping through\nwebpack's plugin array, removing the plugin, and re-instantiating it with your own arguments.\nconfig.plugins = config.plugins.map(plugin => {\n  if (plugin.constructor.name !== 'EnvironmentPlugin') {\n    return plugin;\n  }\n\n  return new webpack.EnvironmentPlugin([...plugin.keys, ...customEnvironmentVariables]);\n});\n\nThis forces a much higher maintenance burden on your project, and this is only a very simple example. Modifying\nloaders created from raw webpack configuration objects can be much more unwieldy.\nUsing webpack-chain affords Neutrino the ability to identify and\nmanipulate parts of the configuration without resorting to object and array manipulation hacks, something not currently\npossible when working with raw webpack configuration data.\nCan I just re-use my existing webpack configuration?\nThe Neutrino configuration does let you merge a configuration object, but does not accept a normal webpack configuration\nout of the box. Since Neutrino uses webpack-chain and enforces naming of plugins, rules, and loaders, you must use an\nobject that corresponds with this \"schema\". Typically this would involve transforming your webpack configuration to nest\nentities requiring a name into an object which maps the name to the entity.\nIn short, you must transform your webpack configuration in order to merge it into the Neutrino configuration cleanly.\nWhat is the difference between middleware and presets?\nThe term \"presets\" are a hold-over from Neutrino pre-v5. Presets are middleware, the difference in reality is in\nname only. To keep the term \"presets\" relevant, we typically want to use it when referring to major project types:\nReact projects, Node.js projects, composite middleware (conglomeration of many middleware), etc.\nThe takeaway: most middleware can just be middleware, and use the term preset for major project types or\ncomposite middleware.\n"},"learning-resources.html":{"url":"learning-resources.html","title":"Learning Resources","keywords":"","body":"Learning Resources\nHere we keep a listing of external learning resources related to Neutrino and its presets, things like blog posts,\ntutorials, screencasts, videos, starter repos, and more.

Each middleware will attempt to be loaded from the current working directory's node_modules, nested\nwithin, by name, or relative file path. If it cannot be found, an exception will be thrown. In addition to any provided\nmiddleware, Neutrino will attempt to load a .neutrinorc.js file as middleware from the current working directory if\nit exists.\nLet's take a look at the CLI usage.\n--help\nUsing neutrino --help will bring up the following help guide:\n❯ neutrino --help\nCommands:\n  start           Build a project in development mode\n  build           Compile the source directory to a bundled build\n  test [files..]  Run all suites from the test directory or provided files\n\nOptions:\n  --inspect  Output a string representation of the configuration used by webpack and exit                     [boolean] [default: false]\n  --use      A list of Neutrino middleware used to configure the build                                        [array] [default: []]\n  --options  Set Neutrino options, config, and environment variables, e.g. --options.env.NODE_ENV production  [default: {}]\n  --quiet    Disable console output of CLI commands                                                           [boolean] [default: false]\n  --debug    Run in debug mode                                                                                [boolean] [default: false]\n  --require  Preload a module prior to loading Neutrino; can be used multiple times                           [array] [default: []]\n  --version  Show version number                                                                              [boolean]\n  --help     Show help                                                                                        [boolean]\n\n--version\nUsing --version will output the current version of the Neutrino CLI to the console and exit.\n❯ neutrino --version\n8.0.0\n\n--use\nThe --use flag can be used in conjunction with any of the top-level commands to specify a collection of\nmiddleware and presets to load. These can be an npm package or a relative path to a module to load as middleware.\n❯ neutrino start --use @neutrinojs/react @neutrinojs/karma\n\nThe Neutrino CLI will not attempt to load any presets and middleware defined in the project's .neutrinorc.js file\nwhen passing middleware via --use.\n--inspect\nThe --inspect flag can be used to write out a stringified version of the webpack configuration which has been\naccumulated by all middleware. When using the --inspect flag, the Neutrino CLI will still import all presets and\nmiddleware that have been supplied, but will then exit after logging the configuration to stdout. No builds, servers, or\nwatchers will be started.\n❯ neutrino start --inspect --use @neutrinojs/react @neutrinojs/jest\n\nThis could also be used to help create diffs between configuration changes. Take the following command:\n❯ neutrino start --inspect --use @neutrinojs/react @neutrinojs/jest\n\nWe can capture this inspection to a file, and capture the change by adding a preset override:\n❯ neutrino start --inspect --use @neutrinojs/react @neutrinojs/jest > a.config\n❯ neutrino start --inspect --use @neutrinojs/react @neutrinojs/jest override.js > b.config\n\nUsing git diff --no-index a.config b.config, we get a pretty diff of the configuration change:\ndiff --git a/a.config b/b.config\nindex 3356802..d4d82ef 100644\n--- a/a.config\n+++ b/b.config\n@@ -3,6 +3,7 @@\n   devtool: 'source-map',\n   entry: {\n     index: [\n-      'babel-polyfill',\n       '/node/src/index.js'\n     ]\n   },\n\n--require\nRequire one or more modules prior to invoking any Neutrino commands. These can be an npm package or a relative path to\na module to require. If you export a function, Neutrino will execute this function for you. If you export a Promise, or\nif you export a function that returns a Promise, Neutrino will wait for it to resolve before invoking any commands.\nUsing --require with multiple Promise-using modules will make Neutrino await all the Promises in parallel prior to\nrunning a command.\nThe --require flag can be especially useful if you need to perform work before running Neutrino each time.\n❯ neutrino start --require load-env.js\n\n❯ neutrino build --require scripts/load-env scripts/fetch-remote-data\n\n❯ neutrino build --require scripts/load-env --require scripts/fetch-remote-data\n\n--debug\nInforms interested middleware that they should be in a state of debugging. This does not currently make Neutrino itself\nbehave any differently; rather it can be used to inform middleware to behave differently, by outputting console\ninformation, inspecting processes, or changing configuration helpful for debugging.\n--quiet\nPrevents the CLI from outputting any console output. Neutrino middleware should also respect this flag when possible,\nbut is not a guarantee.\n--options\nUsed to override Neutrino options, configuration, and environments from the command line. This would typically be used\nfor specifying one-off changes that may not be appropriate to encapsulate in .neutrinorc.js. The --options flag is\nformatted as \"dotted-object\" syntax, meaning it should be used as --options. [value]. This can also be used\nto toggle Boolean options to true by providing no value. Some examples:\n❯ neutrino start --options.host 192.168.1.10 --options.port 3000\n\n❯ neutrino build --options.env.NODE_ENV development --options.env.CUSTOM_ENV_VAR customValue\n\n# Sets options.https to true\n❯ neutrino start --options.https\n\n❯ neutrino start --options.config.devtool eval\n\n# Sets config.node.Buffer to true\n❯ neutrino start --options.config.node.Buffer\n\nneutrino start\nUsing the command neutrino start builds a project in development mode, also starting a development server or source\nwatcher depending on the middleware or configuration used. This command sets the NODE_ENV environment variable to\ndevelopment by default.\nneutrino build\nUsing the command neutrino build builds a project in production mode, rendering static assets to the configured build\noutput destination. This command sets the NODE_ENV environment variable to production by default.\nneutrino test\nUsing the command neutrino test passes execution onto a test runner preset. It is up to the preset or middleware being\nused to determine how source files are built or provided to tests. See your particular test middleware for details. This\ncommand sets the NODE_ENV environment variable to test by default.\nLooking at the --help for neutrino test:\n❯ neutrino test --help\nneutrino test [files..]\n\nOptions:\n  --inspect   Output a string representation of the configuration used by Neutrino and exit                    [boolean] [default: false]\n  --use       A list of Neutrino middleware used to configure the build                                        [array] [default: []]\n  --options   Set Neutrino options, config, and environment variables, e.g. --options.env.NODE_ENV production  [default: {}]\n  --quiet     Disable console output of CLI commands                                                           [boolean] [default: false]\n  --debug     Run in debug mode                                                                                [boolean] [default: false]\n  --version   Show version number                                                                              [boolean]\n  --help      Show help                                                                                        [boolean]\n  --coverage  Collect test coverage information and generate report                                            [boolean] [default: false]\n  --watch     Watch source files for changes and re-run tests                                                  [boolean] [default: false]\n\nUsing the command neutrino test will execute every test file located in your\ntesting directory. You may also provide to this command the specific test files you wish\nto run individually. It is important to note that when combined with the --use parameter, you should use two\ndashes after the last preset to denote the end of the presets and the beginning of the test files.\n❯ neutrino test a_test.js b_test.js\n\n❯ neutrino test --use @neutrinojs/react @neutrinojs/karma -- a_test.js b_test.js\n\nYou can also pass a flag --watch to watch source files for changes and re-run tests, if your middleware supports it.\n❯ neutrino test --watch\n\nAs well, you can pass a flag --coverage to collect test coverage information and generate a report, if your middleware\nsupports it.\n❯ neutrino test --coverage\n\nCustom commands\nMiddleware has the ability to register named commands with Neutrino. These registered commands are also available to\ninvoke from the CLI provided the middleware registering the command has been loaded when it is time for the CLI to\ninvoke the command.\n// custom.js\nmodule.exports = (neutrino) => {\n  neutrino.register('hello', () => 'HELLO WORLD!');\n};\n\n❯ neutrino hello --use custom.js\nHELLO WORLD!\n\nExit codes\nWhen the CLI creates an instance of Neutrino, it waits for all commands to either resolve or reject their registered\ncommand. If the command succeeded, the CLI will exit with code 0. If there were errors, the CLI will log the errors\nto the console and exit with code 1. This makes it easier to use Neutrino commands for status reasons, such\nas failing a pull request on continuous integration if any tests fail or if there are linter errors.\n"},"api/":{"url":"api/","title":"API","keywords":"","body":"Neutrino API\nWhen using Neutrino via the CLI, it creates an instance of the Neutrino API which picks up\nany middleware and arguments passed on the command line or located in your .neutrinorc.js. If you desire, you can\nalso create your own instance of the Neutrino API and interact with it programmatically.\nImporting\nThe default export of the Neutrino module is an object with the core Neutrino API, along with available\nbuilt-in functions for the API to run:\nconst {\n  Neutrino,\n  build,\n  inspect,\n  start,\n  test\n} = require('neutrino');\n\nThe Neutrino function is the lowest-level API, and each of the other methods can be used with the Neutrino\nAPI for executing their functionality. First, we will cover the Neutrino API and\nlater showing how to use the runnable functions.\nInstantiation\nIn order to access the Neutrino API, you must require or import it and invoke it, passing in any\noptions:\nUsing require:\nconst { Neutrino } = require('neutrino');\n\nconst api = Neutrino(options);\n\nUsing ES imports:\nimport { Neutrino } from 'neutrino';\n\nconst api = Neutrino(options);\n\nAPI options\nThe Neutrino function can accept an object for setting a number of useful options.\nPath options\nThe path options mentioned afterwards are generated using JavaScript object getters and setters, meaning their\nassignment and access will produce a computed value each time. For example, the value set for options.source may not\nbe the same as the value retrieved, as they will be path-normalized to absolute paths:\napi.options.source = 'lib';\nconsole.log(api.options.source); //   /project/lib\n\napi.options.mains.index = 'app.js';\nconsole.log(api.options.mains.index); //   /project/src/app.js\napi.options.source = 'lib';\nconsole.log(api.options.mains.index); //   /project/lib/app.js\n\noptions.root\nSet the base directory which Neutrino middleware and presets operate on. Typically this is the project directory where\nthe package.json would be located. If the option is not set, Neutrino defaults it to process.cwd(). If a relative\npath is specified, it will be resolved relative to process.cwd(); absolute paths will be used as-is.\nNeutrino({\n  // if not specified, defaults to process.cwd()\n\n  // relative, resolves to process.cwd() + website\n  root: 'website',\n\n  // absolute\n  root: '/code/website'\n})\n\noptions.source\nSet the directory which contains the application source code. If the option is not set, Neutrino defaults it to src.\nIf a relative path is specified, it will be resolved relative to options.root; absolute paths will be used as-is.\nNeutrino({\n  // if not specified, defaults to options.root + src\n\n  // relative, resolves to options.root + lib\n  source: 'lib',\n\n  // absolute\n  source: '/code/website/lib'\n})\n\noptions.output\nSet the directory which will be the output of built assets. If the option is not set, Neutrino defaults it to build.\nIf a relative path is specified, it will be resolved relative to options.root; absolute paths will be used as-is.\nNeutrino({\n  // if not specified, defaults to options.root + build\n\n  // relative, resolves to options.root + dist\n  output: 'dist',\n\n  // absolute\n  output: '/code/website/dist'\n})\n\noptions.tests\nSet the directory that contains test files. If the option is not set, Neutrino defaults it to test.\nIf a relative path is specified, it will be resolved relative to options.root; absolute paths will be used as-is.\nNeutrino({\n  // if not specified, defaults to options.root + test\n\n  // relative, resolves to options.root + testing\n  tests: 'testing',\n\n  // absolute\n  tests: '/code/website/testing'\n})\n\noptions.mains\nSet the main entry points for the application. If the option is not set, Neutrino defaults it to:\n{\n  index: 'index'\n}\n\nNotice the entry point has no extension; the extension is resolved by webpack. If relative paths are specified,\nthey will be computed and resolved relative to options.source; absolute paths will be used as-is.\nNeutrino({\n  mains: {\n    // If not specified, defaults to options.source + index.*\n    index: 'index',\n\n    // Override to relative, resolves to options.source + entry.*\n    index: 'entry',\n\n    // Override to absolute path\n    index: '/code/website/src/entry.js'\n  }\n})\n\noptions.node_modules\nSet the directory which contains the Node.js modules of the project. If the option is not set, Neutrino defaults it to\nnode_modules. If a relative path is specified, it will be resolved relative to options.root; absolute paths will be\nused as-is.\nNeutrino({\n  // if not specified, defaults to options.root + node_modules\n\n  // relative, resolves to options.root + modules\n  node_modules: 'modules',\n\n  // absolute\n  node_modules: '/code/website/modules'\n})\n\nOther options\noptions.debug\nInforms interested middleware that they should be in a state of debugging. This does not currently make Neutrino itself\nbehave any differently, rather it can be used to inform middleware to behave differently, by outputting console\ninformation, inspecting processes, or changing configuration which is helpful for debugging.\noptions.env\nWhen using the CLI and the higher-level API functions, environment variables are automatically set based on the command\nyou are using. When using the Neutrino low-level API this is not the case, and you should specify an env option\nto the API prior to calling any build commands or loading any middleware if you expect them to build correctly based on\ntheir environment target.\nUse options.env to set environment variables and make them available to middleware for conditional operations.\nNeutrino({\n  env: {\n    NODE_ENV: 'production'\n  }\n});\n\nprocess.env.NODE_ENV // \"production\"\n\noptions.command\nThe currently running CLI command, e.g. build, start, lint, etc. This value is typically\nset by the CLI when instantiating the API, but can also be set manually. This value is used by some\nmiddleware to determine when to augment the configuration with certain functionality.\noptions.extensions\nInforms interested middleware the preferred list of module extensions to support.\nBy default, options.extensions is set to ['js', 'jsx', 'vue', 'ts', 'tsx', 'mjs'].\noptions.packageJson\nReturns the package.json object defined at the root level of the project.\nNeutrino API\nWhen creating a Neutrino instance, you have the option of providing an object which can be passed as options to\nmiddleware as neutrino.options.\nconst { Neutrino } = require('neutrino');\n\nconst neutrino = Neutrino();\n\n// or with optional options\nconst neutrino = Neutrino({ output: 'dist' });\n\noptions\nAn object containing various properties for the benefit of the API and middleware. This can contain\noptions set by both Neutrino and any included middleware.\nconfig\nWhen constructing a Neutrino instance, a property of config is set to be a new instance of\nwebpack-chain. This property is then available to all middleware\nwhich subsequently augment it with their specific configuration. All middleware and presets added use this single\nconfig to store their data, meaning that middleware load order has an effect on which config values take precedence.\nMiddleware loaded first will have any configuration overridden by later middleware with matching properties.\nuse(middlewareFormat)\nUse a Neutrino middleware format, optionally providing options which will be passed to the middleware.\nMiddleware functions will be invoked with two arguments:\n\nThe Neutrino API instance\nAny middleware options argument passed to use.\n\nManually loading middleware with use\nUsing the Neutrino API you can load middleware and presets (which are also just middleware)\nusing the use method. The use method takes in a middleware format and optionally any options that should be\npassed to the middleware. See middleware formats for details on the different ways to\nspecify middleware.\n/**\n* use::\n*   (Function, Object)\n*   (String, Object)\n*   (Array [Middleware, Object])\n*   (Object)\n*/\n// use :: (Function, Object)\nneutrino.use(neutrino => { /* ... */ }, { /* options */ })\n\n// use :: (String, Object)\nneutrino.use('middleware', { /* options */ })\n\n// use :: (Array [Middleware, Object])\nneutrino.use(['middleware', { /* options */ }])\n\n// use :: (Object)\nneutrino.use({\n  options: { /* ... */ },\n  use: [\n    // ...even more middleware\n  ]\n})\n\nAny options passed to a middleware object format will be set on the Neutrino API instance prior to consuming any\nmiddleware in the use array.\nEvents\non(eventName, handler)\nAdd a handler function to a Neutrino instance that listens to events named eventName. If the event handler\nis going to be used with emitForAll, ensure the handler returns a Promise. Use the * event name to\nexecute the handler for all events. Note that * events are triggered after named events.\napi.on('custom-event', () => {\n  // ...\n});\n\noff(eventName, handler)\nRemove a handler function from listening to a particular eventName, including * events.\nconst handler = () => /* ... */;\n\napi.on('custom-event', handler);\n\napi.off('custom-event', handler);\n\nemit(eventName, payload)\nInvoke all handlers for the given eventName. Note that * handlers are executed after named events. You may\nalso pass an optional payload value to be passed as an argument to the associated event handler function.\napi.emit('custom-event', { /* payload */ });\n\nemitForAll(eventName, payload)\nInvoke all handlers for the given eventName, meant for usage with Promise-dependent events. For example, calling\nemitForAll('build') will trigger an event named build, and each event handler can return a Promise denoting when it\nis finished. When all events have finished, this call will resolve.\nThis method returns a Promise which resolves when all event handlers have also resolved.\napi\n  .emitForAll('custom-event')\n  .then(() => console.log('All custom-events have resolved!'));\n\nBy passing an additional argument for payload, you can pass custom data to all the event handlers\napi.emitForAll('custom-event', { custom: 'payload' });\n\n// ...\n\napi.on('custom-event', (args, payload) => {\n  console.log(payload.custom); // \"payload\"\n});\n\nconfig.toConfig()\nWhile tools like webpack-chain provide a convenient API for creating webpack configurations, this is not a format that\nis understandable by webpack. With config.toConfig(), the webpack-chain instance at config will be converted to\na configuration object readable directly by webpack.\napi.config.toConfig(); // -> { ... }\n\nregister(command, handler, description = '')\nThis method registers a new command which can be run from the API at a later time. This function takes three\narguments: a String command name, a Function which accepts a webpack configuration and the API, and an optional string\ndescription. The return value of handler depends on the expected usage of the command. The description is optional,\nbut useful when using --help from the command line to view available commands.\nThe handler function can accept two arguments:\n\nA webpack configuration object. This is the result of calling api.config.toConfig(), and represents a\nwebpack-usable object\nThe Neutrino API instance\n\n_Example: add a new runnable command which resolves with a JSON-formatted webpack configuration:`\napi.register(\n  'jsonify',\n  config => JSON.stringify(config, null, 2),\n  'Output a JSON representation of the accumulated webpack configuration'\n);\n\nThe registered command can be triggered from call(), run(), or via the CLI.\nrequire(moduleId)\nThis method is typically used internally by the Neutrino API to attempt to require a string module ID in various paths\nbefore failing. Takes a String moduleId and returns the first exports of the module it is able to require. This\nwill throw an exception if Neutrino is unable to require the specified module ID in any of its know paths.\ncall(commandName)\nThis API method will invoke a command function that has been previously defined by the register method.\nThe commandName argument should be a String. Any necessary middleware should be used prior to invoking call.\nThe call method will invoke the registered command with two arguments: a webpack configuration object, and the\ninstance of the Neutrino API. The return value of using call will be the return value of invoking the registered\nhandler with these two arguments.\nFor a concrete example, the eslint middleware registers an eslintrc\ncommand. The results of this command can be returned with call, which is loaded within\n.neutrinorc.js in this example:\nconst { Neutrino } = require('neutrino');\n\nconst eslintConfig = Neutrino({ root: __dirname })\n  .use('.neutrinorc.js')\n  .call('eslintrc');\n\nrun(commandName)\nThis API method will invoke a command function that has been previously defined by the register method.\nThe commandName argument should be a String. Any necessary middleware should be used prior to invoking run.\nEvery runnable command performs the following flow:\n\nTriggers all pre* event handlers for the given command name\nTriggers all prerun event handlers\nInvokes the given registered command function\nTriggers all event handlers for the given command name\nTriggers all run event handlers\n\nThe run method will invoke the registered command with two arguments: a webpack configuration object, and the\ninstance of the Neutrino API. Calling a runnable command will return a\nFuture which can then be used to kick off the above flow. This Future will\nbe resolved with the resolution value of the command, or rejected with any errors the command provides. The return\nvalue from the registered command can be any synchronous value, Promise, or Future, and Neutrino will properly chain\nfrom this.\nThe Neutrino package exports functions to automate key parts of interacting with the Neutrino API, and they are named\nbuild, inspect, start, and test. These are command functions that are invoked when using the CLI.\nAs an example, the CLI does this similar to the following:\nconst { Neutrino, build } = require('neutrino');\n\nconst api = Neutrino();\n\napi.register('build', build);\n\n// later\napi\n  .use(middleware)\n  .run('build')\n  .fork(\n    (errs) => { /* handle errors */ },\n    () => { /* handle success */ }\n  );\n\n_Example: execute the jsonify command we registered in the register() example, and resolve with a Future`:\nconst api = Neutrino();\nconst Future = require('fluture');\n\napi.register('jsonify', config => Future.of(JSON.stringify(config, null, 2)));\n\n// ...\n\napi\n  .run('jsonify')\n  .fork(console.error, json => console.log(json));\n\n_Example: execute the jsonify command we registered in the register() example, and resolve with a Promise`:\nconst api = Neutrino();\n\napi.register('jsonify', config => Promise.resolve(JSON.stringify(config, null, 2)));\n\n// ...\n\napi\n  .run('jsonify')\n  .fork(console.error, json => console.log(json));\n\nThe run method takes a single argument, a String command name which the API can execute,\nwhich has been previously registered with register.\nPrior to starting this process, Neutrino will trigger and wait for pre{command} and prerun events to\nfinish. After it is complete, Neutrino will trigger and wait for {command} and run events to finish.\nconst { Neutrino, build } = require('neutrino');\nconst api = Neutrino();\n\napi\n  .register('build', build)\n  .use('@neutrinojs/react')\n  .run('build')\n  .fork(\n    errors => errors.forEach(console.error),\n    stats => console.log(stats.toString({ colors: true }))\n  );\n\nRunnable Functions\nThe following functions are exported from Neutrino and can be registered with the API to be executed from run\n(recommended) or call. These functions are used internally by the CLI, which creates its own instance of the API and\nregisters them prior to run. Since each of them can be registered directly with the API, they each have the same\nsignature, accepting a webpack configuration and an API instance.\nstart(webpackConfig, neutrinoApi)\nThe start function is responsible for creating a development bundle, and when possible, starting a development\nserver or source watcher. If the Neutrino config contains options for devServer, then a webpack-dev-server will be\nstarted, otherwise a webpack source watcher will be started.\nThe start function returns a Future which can then be used to\nkick off the runnable flow. This Future will be resolved with a webpack compiler (for example, if you wish to listen for\nadditional build events), or reject with an array of errors. This resolution will be completed when the dev server\nor webpack watcher has been started.\nExample: using the run method:\nconst { Neutrino, start } = require('neutrino');\nconst api = Neutrino();\n\napi\n  .register('start', start)\n  .use('@neutrinojs/react')\n  .run('start')\n  .fork(\n    errors => errors.forEach(err => console.error(err)),\n    compiler => console.log('App running!')\n  );\n\nExample: calling start manually:\nconst { Neutrino, start } = require('neutrino');\nconst api = Neutrino();\n\napi.use('@neutrinojs/react');\n\nstart(api.config.toConfig(), api)\n  .fork(\n    errors => errors.forEach(err => console.error(err)),\n    compiler => console.log('App running!')\n  );\n\nbuild(webpackConfig, neutrinoApi)\nThe build function is responsible for creating a bundle typically used for production.\nThe build function returns a Future which can then be used to\nkick off the runnable flow. This Future will be resolved with a webpack stats object about the build, or reject with an\narray of errors. This resolution will be completed when the build has been completed.\nExample: using the run method:\nconst { Neutrino, build } = require('neutrino');\nconst api = Neutrino();\n\napi\n  .register('build', build)\n  .use('@neutrinojs/node')\n  .run('build')\n  .fork(\n    errors => errors.forEach(err => console.error(err)),\n    stats => console.log(stats.toString({ colors: true }))\n  );\n\nExample: calling build manually:\nconst { Neutrino, build } = require('neutrino');\nconst api = Neutrino();\n\napi.use('@neutrinojs/node');\n\nbuild(api.config.toConfig(), api)\n  .fork(\n    errors => errors.forEach(err => console.error(err)),\n    stats => console.log(stats.toString({ colors: true }))\n  );\n\ntest(webpackConfig, neutrinoApi)\nThe test function is typically used for gathering middleware and options needed for testing and triggering relevant\nevents as a signal to test middleware that they may run. Using the test method has no other functionality other than\nperforming the automated runnable flow outlined above. Since test() does nothing other than triggering this flow,\nwithout middleware listening for test events, nothing will happen. For this reason, it is recommended that test be\nused with the run method to ensure that all test-related events are properly retriggered. After Neutrino triggers and\nwaits for test events to finish, the test runners will do their work and test() can resolve.\nAny args passed to the API as options are passed on to the event handlers and typically have properties for an array\nof files to test, as well as a property for watching and rerunning tests.\nThe test function returns a Future which can then be used to\nkick off the runnable flow. This Future will be resolved, or reject with an error. This resolution will be completed\nwhen the testing has been finished.\nExample: Using the run method:\nconst { Neutrino, test } = require('neutrino');\nconst api = Neutrino();\n\napi\n  .register('test', test)\n  .use('@neutrinojs/node')\n  .use('@neutrinojs/mocha')\n  .run('test')\n  .fork(\n    err => console.error(err),\n    () => console.log('Testing completed!')\n  );\n\n// With API args\nconst api = Neutrino({\n  args: {\n    files: [/* ... */],\n    watch: true\n  }\n});\n\napi\n  .register('test', test)\n  .use('@neutrinojs/node')\n  .use('@neutrinojs/mocha')\n  .run('test')\n  .fork(\n    errors => errors.forEach(err => console.error(err)),\n    () => console.log('Testing completed!')\n  );\n\nExample: calling test manually:\nconst { Neutrino, test } = require('neutrino');\nconst api = Neutrino();\n\napi\n  .use('@neutrinojs/node')\n  .use('@neutrinojs/mocha');\n\ntest(api.config.toConfig(), api)\n  .fork(\n    err => console.error(err),\n    () => console.log('Testing completed!')\n  );\n\ninspect(webpackConfig, neutrinoApi)\nThe inspect() function is responsible for creating an object string which represents a webpack configuration for the\nprovided middleware and options. Upon execution inspect will:\n\nReceive the webpack configuration object\nDeep-sort the object\nStringify the object with 2 spaces (not JSON stringified!)\n\nThe inspect function returns a Future which can then be used to\nkick off the runnable flow. This Future will be resolved with a string representation of the webpack config, or reject\nwith an error.\nExample: using the run method:\nconst { Neutrino, inspect } = require('neutrino');\nconst api = Neutrino();\n\napi\n  .register('inspect', inspect)\n  .use('@neutrinojs/node')\n  .run('inspect')\n  .fork(\n    errors => errors.forEach(err => console.error(err)),\n    config => console.log(config)\n  );\n\nExample: calling inspect manually:\nconst { Neutrino, inspect } = require('neutrino');\nconst api = Neutrino();\n\napi.use('@neutrinojs/node');\n\ninspect(api.config.toConfig(), api)\n  .fork(\n    err => err => console.error(err),\n    config => console.log(config)\n  );\n\nHelper Methods\nregexFromExtensions\nUsing the Neutrino API you can get a regex expression from a list of extensions using the regexFromExtensions method.\nThe regexFromExtensions takes in an array of extensions as a parameter but can be invoked\nwithout any parameters which fallback to neutrino.options.extensions.\n// resolves to /\\.(vue|js)$/\nneutrino.regexFromExtensions(['vue', 'js']);\n\n// defaults neutrino.options.extensions which resolves to /\\.(js|jsx|vue|ts|tsx|mjs)$/\nneutrino.regexFromExtensions();\n\n"},"webpack-chain.html":{"url":"webpack-chain.html","title":"Configuration API - webpack-chain","keywords":"","body":"webpack-chain: Neutrino configuration API\nUse a chaining API to generate and simplify the modification of\nwebpack 2 and 3 configurations.\nThis documentation corresponds to v4 of webpack-chain, which Neutrino utilizes.\nNote: while webpack-chain is utilized extensively in Neutrino, the package is completely\nstandalone and can be used by any project. See the webpack-chain repo for standalone documentation.\nIntroduction\nwebpack's core configuration is based on creating and modifying a\npotentially unwieldy JavaScript object. While this is OK for configurations\non individual projects, trying to share these objects across projects and\nmake subsequent modifications gets messy, as you need to have a deep\nunderstanding of the underlying object structure to make those changes.\nwebpack-chain attempts to improve this process by providing a chainable or\nfluent API for creating and modifying webpack configurations. Key portions\nof the API can be referenced by user-specified names, which helps to\nstandardize how to modify a configuration across projects.\nThis is easier explained through the examples following.\nGetting Started\nIn the Neutrino API, the config property is an instance of webpack-chain. For this guide,\nour example base configuration will be .neutrinorc.js in the root of our project directory.\nThis can utilize either the Object format or\nFunction format to access the Neutrino API:\n// .neutrinorc.js\n\n// Object format\nmodule.exports = {\n  use: [\n    (neutrino) => {\n      // access the Neutrino API\n    }\n  ]\n};\n\n// Function format\nmodule.exports = (neutrino) => {\n  // access the Neutrino API\n};\n\nIn our examples we will utilize the Function format for sake of space.\n// Make configuration changes using the chaining API.\n// Every API call tracks a change to the stored configuration.\nmodule.exports = (neutrino) => {\n  neutrino.config\n    // Interact with entry points\n    .entry('index')\n      .add('src/index.js')\n      .end()\n\n    // Modify output settings\n    .output\n      .path('dist')\n      .filename('[name].bundle.js');\n\n  // Create named rules which can be modified later or\n  // in other middleware/presets\n  neutrino.config.module\n    .rule('lint')\n      .test(/\\.js$/)\n      .pre()\n      .include\n        .add('src')\n        .end()\n      // Even create named uses (loaders)\n      .use('eslint')\n        .loader('eslint-loader')\n        .options({\n          rules: {\n            semi: 'off'\n          }\n        });\n\n  neutrino.config.module\n    .rule('compile')\n      .test(/\\.js$/)\n      .include\n        .add('src')\n        .add('test')\n        .end()\n      .use('babel')\n        .loader('babel-loader')\n        .options({\n          presets: [\n            ['babel-preset-es2015', { modules: false }]\n          ]\n        });\n\n  // Create named plugins too!\n  neutrino.config\n    .plugin('clean')\n      .use(CleanPlugin, [['dist'], { root: '/dir' }]);\n};\n\nChainedMap\nOne of the core API interfaces in Neutrino configuration is a ChainedMap. A ChainedMap operates\nsimilar to a JavaScript Map, with some conveniences for chaining and generating configuration.\nIf a property is marked as being a ChainedMap, it will have an API and methods as described below:\nUnless stated otherwise, these methods will return the ChainedMap, allowing you to chain these methods.\n// Remove all entries from a Map.\nclear()\n\n// Remove a single entry from a Map given its key.\n// key: *\ndelete(key)\n\n// Fetch the value from a Map located at the corresponding key.\n// key: *\n// returns: value\nget(key)\n\n// Set a value on the Map stored at the `key` location.\n// key: *\n// value: *\nset(key, value)\n\n// Returns `true` or `false` based on whether a Map as has a value set at a particular key.\n// key: *\n// returns: Boolean\nhas(key)\n\n// Returns an array of all the values stored in the Map.\n// returns: Array\nvalues()\n\n// Returns an object of all the entries in the backing Map\n// where the key is the object property, and the value\n// corresponding to the key. Will return `undefined` if the backing\n// Map is empty.\n// This will order properties by their name if the value is\n// a ChainedMap that used .before() or .after().\n// returns: Object, undefined if empty\nentries()\n`\n\n// Provide an object which maps its properties and values\n// into the backing Map as keys and values.\n// You can also provide an array as the second argument\n// for property names to omit from being merged.\n// obj: Object\n// omit: Optional Array\nmerge(obj, omit)\n\n// Execute a function against the current configuration context\n// handler: Function -> ChainedMap\n  // A function which is given a single argument of the ChainedMap instance\nbatch(handler)\n\n// Conditionally execute a function to continue configuration\n// condition: Boolean\n// whenTruthy: Function -> ChainedMap\n  // invoked when condition is truthy, given a single argument of the ChainedMap instance\n// whenFalsy: Optional Function -> ChainedMap\n  // invoked when condition is falsy, given a single argument of the ChainedMap instance\nwhen(condition, whenTruthy, whenFalsy)\n\nChainedSet\nAnother of the core API interfaces in Neutrino configuration is a ChainedSet. A ChainedSet operates\nsimilar to a JavaScript Set, with some conveniences for chaining and generating configuration.\nIf a property is marked as being a ChainedSet, it will have an API and methods as described below:\nUnless stated otherwise, these methods will return the ChainedSet, allowing you to chain these methods.\n// Add/append a value to the end of a Set.\n// value: *\nadd(value)\n\n// Add a value to the beginning of a Set.\n// value: *\nprepend(value)\n\n// Remove all values from a Set.\nclear()\n\n// Remove a specific value from a Set.\n// value: *\ndelete(value)\n\n// Returns `true` or `false` based on whether or not the\n// backing Set contains the specified value.\n// value: *\n// returns: Boolean\nhas(value)\n\n// Returns an array of values contained in the backing Set.\n// returns: Array\nvalues()\n\n// Concatenates the given array to the end of the backing Set.\n// arr: Array\nmerge(arr)\n\n// Execute a function against the current configuration context\n// handler: Function -> ChainedSet\n  // A function which is given a single argument of the ChainedSet instance\nbatch(handler)\n\n// Conditionally execute a function to continue configuration\n// condition: Boolean\n// whenTruthy: Function -> ChainedSet\n  // invoked when condition is truthy, given a single argument of the ChainedSet instance\n// whenFalsy: Optional Function -> ChainedSet\n  // invoked when condition is falsy, given a single argument of the ChainedSet instance\nwhen(condition, whenTruthy, whenFalsy)\n\nShorthand methods\nA number of shorthand methods exist for setting a value on a ChainedMap\nwith the same key as the shorthand method name.\nFor example, devServer.hot is a shorthand method, so it can be used as:\n// A shorthand method for setting a value on a ChainedMap\nneutrino.config.devServer.hot(true);\n\n// This would be equivalent to:\nneutrino.config.devServer.set('hot', true);\n\nA shorthand method is chainable, so calling it will return the original instance,\nallowing you to continue to chain.\nConfig\nMoving to deeper points in the configuration API will change the context of what you\nare modifying. You can move back to the higher context by either referencing\nthe top-level neutrino.config again, or by calling .end() to move up one level.\nIf you are familiar with jQuery, .end() works similarly. All API calls\nwill return the API instance at the current context unless otherwise\nspecified. This is so you may chain API calls continuously if desired.\nFor details on the specific values that are valid for all shorthand and low-level methods,\nplease refer to their corresponding name in the\nwebpack docs hierarchy.\nConfig : ChainedMap\n\nConfig shorthand methods\nneutrino.config\n  .amd(amd)\n  .bail(bail)\n  .cache(cache)\n  .devtool(devtool)\n  .context(context)\n

Note that this is not a webpack configuration\nobject, but you may transform a webpack configuration object before providing it to Neutrino configuration\nto match its layout.\nneutrino.config.merge({ devtool: 'source-map' });\n\nneutrino.config.get('devtool') // \"source-map\"\n\n// Neutrino configuration \"schematic\"\n// Merging an object into Neutrino configuration\n// should have any properties you set follow this\n// \"schematic\" format.\nneutrino.config.merge({\n  [key]: value,\n\n  amd,\n  bail,\n  cache,\n  devtool,\n  context,\n  externals,\n  loader,\n  profile,\n  recordsPath,\n  recordsInputPath,\n  recordsOutputPath,\n  stats,\n  target,\n  watch,\n  watchOptions,\n\n  entry: {\n    [name]: [...values]\n  },\n\n  plugin: {\n    [name]: {\n      plugin: WebpackPlugin,\n      args: [...args],\n      before,\n      after\n    }\n  },\n\n  devServer: {\n    [key]: value,\n\n    clientLogLevel,\n    compress,\n    contentBase,\n    filename,\n    headers,\n    historyApiFallback,\n    host,\n    hot,\n    hotOnly,\n    https,\n    inline,\n    lazy,\n    noInfo,\n    overlay,\n    port,\n    proxy,\n    quiet,\n    setup,\n    stats,\n    watchContentBase\n  },\n\n  node: {\n    [key]: value\n  },\n\n  performance: {\n    [key]: value,\n\n    hints,\n    maxEntrypointSize,\n    maxAssetSize,\n    assetFilter\n  },\n\n  resolve: {\n    [key]: value,\n\n    alias: {\n      [key]: value\n    },\n    aliasFields: [...values],\n    descriptionFields: [...values],\n    extensions: [...values],\n    mainFields: [...values],\n    mainFiles: [...values],\n    modules: [...values],\n\n    plugin: {\n      [name]: {\n        plugin: WebpackPlugin,\n        args: [...args],\n        before,\n        after\n      }\n    }\n  },\n\n  resolveLoader: {\n    [key]: value,\n\n    extensions: [...values],\n    modules: [...values],\n    moduleExtensions: [...values],\n    packageMains: [...values]\n  },\n\n  module: {\n    [key]: value,\n\n    rule: {\n      [name]: {\n        [key]: value,\n\n        enforce,\n        issuer,\n        parser,\n        resource,\n        resourceQuery,\n        test,\n\n        include: [...paths],\n        exclude: [...paths],\n\n        oneOf: {\n          [name]: Rule\n        },\n\n        use: {\n          [name]: {\n            loader: LoaderString,\n            options: LoaderOptions,\n            before,\n            after\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n})\n\nConditional configuration\nWhen working with instances of ChainedMap and ChainedSet, you can perform conditional configuration using when.\nYou must specify an expression to when() which will be evaluated for truthiness or falsiness. If the expression is\ntruthy, the first function argument will be invoked with an instance of the current chained instance. You can optionally\nprovide a second function to be invoked when the condition is falsy, which is also given the current chained instance.\n// Example: Only add minify plugin during production\nneutrino.config\n  .when(process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production', config => {\n    config\n      .plugin('minify')\n      .use(BabelMinifyWebpackPlugin);\n  });\n\n// Example: Only add minify plugin during production,\n// otherwise set devtool to source-map\nneutrino.config\n  .when(process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production',\n    config => config.plugin('minify').use(BabelMinifyWebpackPlugin),\n    config => config.devtool('source-map')\n  );\n\n"},"customization/":{"url":"customization/","title":"Customization","keywords":"","body":"Neutrino Customization\nNo two JavaScript projects are ever the same, and as such there may be times when you will need to make modifications\nto the way your Neutrino presets are building your project. Neutrino provides a mechanism to augment presets and\nmiddleware in the context of a project without resorting to creating and publishing an entirely independent preset.\n.neutrinorc.js\nFirst, you will need to create a .neutrinorc.js file in the root of your project. You\nmay have already done this if you specified your middleware via .neutrinorc.js\nas opposed to CLI --use.\nThe .neutrinorc.js file is picked up by Neutrino automatically if it exists. This can simplify your Neutrino commands\nby making them as simple as neutrino start or neutrino build. If you do all your customization within\n.neutrinorc.js, the CLI will pick up these changes every time you run it.\nMiddleware formats\nBefore we delve into making customizations in .neutrinorc.js, it's important to note that this file can be in any\nvalid middleware format that Neutrino accepts. For project-based customization, it is\nrecommended to use the object format, and that will be the format we focus on for the remainder of this guide. Should\nyou need a lot of API customization, you may still opt to write your .neutrinorc.js file in the function format.\nYour .neutrinorc.js file is a JavaScript module which will be required by Neutrino using Node.js. Any code written in\nthis file should be usable by the version of Node.js you have running on your system when running Neutrino. The\n.neutrinorc.js file should export an object or function depending on which format you opt to use.\nmodule.exports = {\n  /* make customizations */\n};\n\nmodule.exports = (neutrino) => {\n  /* make customizations */\n};\n\nIn a nutshell, the .neutrinorc.js file is wholly middleware.\nOverriding Neutrino options\nNeutrino has a number of useful options for customizing its behavior, and these can be overriden by using an\nobject at the options property:\noptions.root\nSet the base directory which Neutrino middleware and presets operate on. Typically this is the project directory where\nthe package.json would be located. If the option is not set, Neutrino defaults it to process.cwd(). If a relative\npath is specified, it will be resolved relative to process.cwd(); absolute paths will be used as-is.\nmodule.exports = {\n  options: {\n    // Override to relative directory, resolves to process.cwd() + website\n    root: 'website',\n    // Override to absolute directory\n    root: '/code/website'\n  }\n};\n\noptions.source\nSet the directory which contains the application source code. If the option is not set, Neutrino defaults it to src.\nIf a relative path is specified, it will be resolved relative to options.root; absolute paths will be used as-is.\nmodule.exports = {\n  options: {\n    // Override to relative directory, resolves to options.root + lib\n    source: 'lib',\n    // Override to absolute directory\n    source: '/code/website/lib'\n  }\n};\n\noptions.output\nSet the directory which will be the output of built assets. If the option is not set, Neutrino defaults it to build.\nIf a relative path is specified, it will be resolved relative to options.root; absolute paths will be used as-is.\nmodule.exports = {\n  options: {\n    // Override to relative directory, resolves to options.root + dist\n    output: 'dist',\n    // Override to absolute directory\n    output: '/code/website/dist'\n  }\n};\n\noptions.tests\nSet the directory that contains test files. If the option is not set, Neutrino defaults it to test.\nIf a relative path is specified, it will be resolved relative to options.root; absolute paths will be used as-is.\nmodule.exports = {\n  options: {\n    // Override to relative directory, resolves to options.root + testing\n    tests: 'testing',\n    // Override to absolute directory\n    tests: '/code/website/testing'\n  }\n};\n\noptions.mains\nSet the main entry points for the application. If the option is not set, Neutrino defaults it to:\n{\n  index: 'index'\n}\n\nNotice the entry point has no extension; the extension is resolved by webpack. If relative paths are specified,\nthey will be computed and resolved relative to options.source; absolute paths will be used as-is.\nmodule.exports = {\n  options: {\n    mains: {\n      // If not specified, defaults to options.source + index\n      index: 'index',\n\n      // Override to relative, resolves to options.source + entry.*\n      index: 'entry',\n\n      // Override to absolute path\n      index: '/code/website/src/entry.js',\n\n      // Add additional main, resolves to options.source + admin.*\n      admin: 'admin'\n    }\n  }\n};\n\noptions.node_modules\nSet the directory which contains the Node.js modules of the project. If the option is not set, Neutrino defaults it to\nnode_modules. If a relative path is specified, it will be resolved relative to options.root; absolute paths will be\nused as-is.\nmodule.exports = {\n  options: {\n    // Override to relative directory, resolves to options.root + modules\n    node_modules: 'modules',\n    // Override to absolute directory\n    node_modules: '/code/website/modules'\n  }\n};\n\nMutating neutrino.options\nWhile it is possible to mutate neutrino.options directly, this should be avoided.\nInstead, it is always recommended to pass an options object to ensure proper normalization.\n// Bad: Using function format, overriding `neutrino.options` properites.\n// Paths will not be relative to `neutrino.options.root` as expected.\nmodule.exports = neutrino => {\n  Object.assign(neutrino.options, {\n    source: 'lib',\n    output: 'dist'\n  });\n}\n\n// Good: Using function format, setting `neutrino.options.*` properties directly.\nmodule.exports = neutrino => {\n  neutrino.options.source = 'lib';\n  neutrino.options.output = 'dist';\n}\n\n// Good: Use object format w/ `use` array\nmodule.exports = {\n  options: {\n    source: 'lib',\n    output: 'dist'\n  },\n  use: [/* ... */]\n}\n\n// Good: Use object format w/ `use` function\nmodule.exports = {\n  options: {\n    source: 'lib',\n    output: 'dist'\n  },\n  use: neutrino => {\n    neutrino.use(/* ... */);\n  }\n}\n\nUsing middleware\nBy specifying a use array in your .neutrinorc.js, you can inform Neutrino to load additional middleware when it\nruns, including any additional files you wish to include as middleware. Each item in this use array can be any\nNeutrino-supported middleware format.\nIn its simplest form, each item can be the string module name or path to middleware you wish Neutrino to require and\nuse for you:\nmodule.exports = {\n  use: [\n    '@neutrinojs/airbnb-base',\n    '@neutrinojs/react',\n    '@neutrinojs/jest',\n    './override.js'\n  ]\n};\n\nIf your middleware module supports its own options, instead of referencing it by string, use an array pair of string\nmodule name and options:\nmodule.exports = {\n  use: [\n    ['@neutrinojs/airbnb-base', {\n      eslint: {\n        rules: {\n          semi: 'off'\n        }\n      }\n    }],\n\n    ['@neutrinojs/react', {\n      polyfills: { async: false },\n      html: { title: 'Epic React App' }\n    }],\n\n    '@neutrinojs/jest'\n  ]\n};\n\nIf you need to make more advanced configuration changes, you can even directly pass a function as middleware to use\nand have access to the Neutrino API:\nmodule.exports = {\n  use: [\n    '@neutrinojs/airbnb-base',\n    '@neutrinojs/react',\n    '@neutrinojs/jest',\n    (neutrino) => neutrino.config.module\n      .rule('style')\n      .use('css')\n      .options({ modules: true })\n  ]\n};\n\nEnvironment-specific overrides\nSometimes you can only make certain configuration changes in certain Node.js environments, or you may choose to\nselectively make changes based on the values of any arbitrary environment variable. These can be done from\n.neutrinorc.js using the env property. Each property within env maps to an environment variable with key-values\nmapping to  environment values which contain further middleware. This works for any environment variable, not just\nNODE_ENV.\nFor example, if you wanted to include additional middleware when NODE_ENV is production:\nmodule.exports = {\n  env: {\n    NODE_ENV: {\n      production: {\n        use: ['@neutrinojs/pwa']\n      }\n    }\n  }\n};\n\nExample: Turn on CSS modules when the environment variable CSS_MODULES=enable:\nmodule.exports = {\n  env: {\n    CSS_MODULES: {\n      // Turn on CSS modules when the environment variable CSS_MODULES=enable\n      enable: (neutrino) => {\n        neutrino.config.module\n          .rule('style')\n            .use('css')\n              .options({ modules: true });\n      }\n    }\n  }\n};\n\nYou may use any middleware format as the value for the matching environment-value mapping.\nAdvanced configuration changes\nMaking deep or complex changes to Neutrino build configuration beyond what middleware options afford you can be done\nusing the function middleware format. If you wish, your entire .neutrinorc.js file can be a middleware function, but\ntypically this function can be inlined directly as an additional item in the use array.\nIf you're familiar with middleware from the Express/connect world, this works similarly. When using Express middleware,\nyou provide a function to Express which receives arguments to modify a request or response along its lifecycle. There\ncan be a number of middleware functions that Express can load, each one potentially modifying a request or response in\nsuccession.\nWhen you add a middleware function to use, this is typically used to override Neutrino's configuration, and you can\nadd as many functions as you wish in succession. Every preset or middleware that Neutrino has loaded follows this same\nmiddleware successive pipeline.\nThe Neutrino API instance provided to your function has a config property that is an instance of\nwebpack-chain. We won't go in-depth of all the configuration\npossibilities here, but encourage you to check out the documentation for webpack-chain for instructions on your\nparticular use case. Just know that you can use webpack-chain to modify any part of the underlying webpack configuration\nusing its API.\nThis neutrino.config is an accumulation of all configuration up to this moment. All Neutrino middleware and presets\ninteract with and make changes through this config, which is all available to you. For example, if you are using the\npresets @neutrinojs/react and @neutrinojs/karma, any config set can be extended, manipulated, or removed.\nExample: Neutrino's React preset adds .jsx as a module extension. Let's remove it.\nmodule.exports = {\n  use: [\n    '@neutrinojs/react',\n    (neutrino) => neutrino.config.resolve.extensions.delete('.jsx')\n  ]\n};\n\nExample: Neutrino's Node.js preset has performance hints disabled. Let's re-enable them.\nmodule.exports = {\n  use: [\n    '@neutrinojs/node',\n    (neutrino) => neutrino.config.performance.hints('error')\n  ]\n};\n\nRemember, middleware can also have their own custom options for making some changes easier without having to resort to\ninteracting with the Neutrino API; see your respective middleware for details. See the documentation on the\nconfiguration API using webpack-chain for all ways you can modify a config instance to solve\nyour use cases.\nConditional configuration\nSome plugins and rules are only available in certain environments. For example, the Web preset only exposes a minify\nplugin during production, leading to issues when trying to modify its settings, but throws an exception during\ndevelopment.\nExample: Remove all arguments to the minify plugin when using the Web preset.\nconfig.when(process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production', config => {\n  config.plugin('minify').tap(args => []);\n});\n\n"},"creating-presets.html":{"url":"creating-presets.html","title":"Creating presets","keywords":"","body":"Creating Neutrino Middleware and Presets\nCreating Neutrino middleware and presets can solve a number of use cases in a manner which captures all the necessary\nconfiguration and dependencies necessary to accomplish those use cases:\n\nYou find yourself needing to make the same modifications to all the projects you work on.\nYour team wants to adopt a managed set of linting rules across projects.\nYou want to add functionality to the build pipeline that has not yet been encapsulated by an existing preset.\nYou want to support building for more platforms than existing presets support.\n\nGetting Started\nNeutrino middleware are Node.js modules or packages that export a middleware format.\nWe call these Neutrino middleware because they sit in the middle of Neutrino and webpack, modifying a configuration with\neach subsequent middleware call. When using the function middleware formats, you can use the Neutrino instance provided\nto the middleware function to modify the configuration, provide your own configuration, expose custom options for your\nmiddleware, listen for build events, and execute custom functionality.\nNeutrino presets are just Neutrino middleware that encapsulate a specific project need or the combination of other\nmiddleware. At a bare minimum, let's start by exporting a middleware function for an empty Neutrino preset:\nmodule.exports = neutrino => {\n  // ...\n};\n\nIf you are using Babel or Neutrino to build your preset (very meta) with ES modules:\nexport default neutrino => {\n  // ...\n};\n\nConfiguring\nThe Neutrino instance provided to your middleware function has a config property that is an instance of\nwebpack-chain. We won't go in-depth of all the configuration\npossibilities here, but encourage you to check out the documentation for webpack-chain for instructions on your\nparticular use cases.\nThis neutrino.config is an accumulation of all configuration set up to this moment. All Neutrino presets and\nmiddleware interact with and make changes through this config, which is all available to your preset.\nEvents\nNeutrino exposes events for various stages of the build process your preset can hook into if necessary.\n\nprestart: Triggered before creating a development bundle, launching a dev server, or a source watcher.\nstart: Triggered after the development bundle has been created the dev server or source watcher has started.\nprebuild: Triggered before creating a production build.\nbuild: Triggered after the production build has completed.\npretest: Triggered before invoking any test runners.\ntest: Triggered when test runners can start, or after they have all completed.\nprerun: Triggered before creating a development bundle, production build, and before invoking any test runners.\nrun: Triggered after the development bundle, production build, or all test runners have completed.\n\nExample: Log to the console when a build finishes.\nmodule.exports = neutrino => {\n  neutrino.on('build', () => console.log('whew!'));\n};\n\nIncluding and merging other middleware\nIf your preset depends on other Neutrino presets and/or middleware, or you are creating a preset that is a combination\nof multiple presets and/or middleware, you can install them as dependencies and simply have Neutrino use them as\nmiddleware. When users install your preset, they will bring along these dependencies defined with your package without\nneeding to to include your extended presets in their own commands.\nExample: Define a Neutrino preset which combines Node.js and Mocha presets.\nconst node = require('@neutrinojs/node');\nconst mocha = require('@neutrinojs/mocha');\n\nmodule.exports = neutrino => {\n  neutrino.use(node);\n  neutrino.use(mocha);\n\n  // neutrino.config now contains the accumulation of configuration from\n  // the Node.js and Mocha presets\n};\n\nSample Preset: JavaScript Standard Style\nLet's create a preset from scratch which allows users to augment their project with\nJavaScript Standard Style. For this sample preset we are using\nYarn for managing dependencies, but you may use the npm client if you desire.\nImportant: this preset is not meant to be functional; rather it is used to demonstrate the concepts of creating\npresets.\n# Create a new directory for your project and change into it:\nmkdir neutrino-preset-standard-style && cd neutrino-preset-standard-style\n\n# Initialize your project with a package.json:\nyarn init --yes\n\n# Install the dependencies needed by our preset\nyarn add standard-loader standard\n\n# Create the main file to the preset, e.g. index.js\ntouch index.js\n\nLet's edit this index.js file to add our preset:\nmodule.exports = neutrino => {\n  neutrino.config.module\n    .rule('lint')\n      .pre()\n      .test(neutrino.regexFromExtensions(['js', 'jsx']))\n      .include\n        .add(neutrino.options.source)\n        .end()\n      .use('standard')\n        .loader(require.resolve('standard-loader'))\n        .options({ snazzy: false });\n};\n\nMiddleware Options\nIf you want to expose custom options for your middleware that are not appropriate to be stored in the Neutrino config,\nyour middleware function can accept a second argument for its options. You may then document to users how they can\ngo about affecting how your middleware works by manipulating these options via their own middleware or .neutrinorc.js.\nYou can then merge these options back with your defaults within your middleware when needed.\nExample:\nmodule.exports = (neutrino, opts = {}) => {\n  const options = Object.assign({\n    quiet: false,\n    logLevel: 'warn'\n  }, opts);\n\n  // ...\n};\n\nWorking with paths\nWhen working with paths, remember that your preset will be running in the context of a project. You should take care\nto define application paths by referencing the current working directory with process.cwd(). For example, if you\nwanted to interact with a file with a project, you would merge the path via path.join(process.cwd(), 'project.file').\nNeutrino provides a number of paths that have been defaulted through neutrino.options or configured by the user.\nPlease consider using these paths for your preset so they play nice with others.\nModifying Neutrino options\nIf you wish to modify Neutrino options, including paths, it is recommended to use the object middleware format so\nNeutrino can guarantee options are merged prior to your middleware being used.\nconst middleware = (neutrino, options) => {\n  // ...\n};\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  options: {\n    source: 'lib',\n    mains: {\n      index: 'application.js'\n    }\n  },\n  use: [middleware]\n}\n\noptions.root\nSet the base directory which Neutrino middleware and presets operate on. Typically this is the project directory where\nthe package.json would be located. If the option is not set, Neutrino defaults it to process.cwd(). If a relative\npath is specified, it will be resolved relative to process.cwd(); absolute paths will be used as-is.\nmodule.exports = neutrino => {\n  // if not specified, defaults to process.cwd()\n  neutrino.options.root;\n};\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  options: {\n    // relative, resolves to process.cwd() + website\n    root: 'website',\n    // absolute\n    root: '/code/website'\n  }\n};\n\noptions.source\nSet the directory which contains the application source code. If the option is not set, Neutrino defaults it to src.\nIf a relative path is specified, it will be resolved relative to options.root; absolute paths will be used as-is.\nmodule.exports = neutrino => {\n  // if not specified, defaults to options.root + src\n  neutrino.options.source;\n};\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  options: {\n    // relative, resolves to options.root + lib\n    source: 'lib',\n    // absolute\n    source: '/code/website/lib'\n  }\n};\n\noptions.output\nSet the directory which will be the output of built assets. If the option is not set, Neutrino defaults it to build.\nIf a relative path is specified, it will be resolved relative to options.root; absolute paths will be used as-is.\nmodule.exports = neutrino => {\n  // if not specified, defaults to options.root + build\n  neutrino.options.output;\n}\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  options: {\n    // relative, resolves to options.root + dist\n    output: 'dist',\n    // absolute\n    output: '/code/website/dist'\n  }\n};\n\noptions.tests\nSet the directory that contains test files. If the option is not set, Neutrino defaults it to test.\nIf a relative path is specified, it will be resolved relative to options.root; absolute paths will be used as-is.\nmodule.exports = neutrino => {\n  // if not specified, defaults to options.root + test\n  neutrino.options.tests;\n};\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  options: {\n    // relative, resolves to options.root + testing\n    tests: 'testing',\n\n    // absolute\n    tests: '/code/website/testing'\n  }\n};\n\noptions.mains\nSet the main entry points for the application. If the option is not set, Neutrino defaults it to:\n{\n  index: 'index'\n}\n\nNotice the entry point has no extension; the extension is resolved by webpack. If relative paths are specified,\nthey will be computed and resolved relative to options.source; absolute paths will be used as-is.\nBy default these main files are not required to be in JavaScript format. They may also potentially be JSX, TypeScript,\nor any other preprocessor language. These extensions should be specified in middleware at\nneutrino.config.resolve.extensions.\nmodule.exports = neutrino => {\n  // if not specified, defaults to an object with a single entry \"index\",\n  // resolved to options.source + index\n  neutrino.options.mains.index;\n};\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  options: {\n    mains: {\n      // If not specified, defaults to options.source + index\n      index: 'index',\n\n      // Override to relative, resolves to options.source + entry.*\n      index: 'entry',\n\n      // Override to absolute path\n      index: '/code/website/src/entry.js',\n\n      // Add additional main, resolves to options.source + admin.*\n      admin: 'admin'\n    }\n  }\n};\n\noptions.node_modules\nSet the directory which contains the Node.js modules of the project. If the option is not set, Neutrino defaults it to\nnode_modules. If a relative path is specified, it will be resolved relative to options.root; absolute paths will be\nused as-is.\nmodule.exports = neutrino => {\n  // if not specified, defaults to options.root + node_modules\n  neutrino.options.node_modules;\n};\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  options: {\n    // relative, resolves to options.root + modules\n    node_modules: 'modules',\n    // absolute\n    node_modules: '/code/website/modules'\n  }\n};\n\noptions.extensions\nSet the preferred list of module extensions to inform interested middleware. If the option is not set,\nNeutrino defaults it to ['js', 'jsx', 'vue', 'ts', 'tsx', 'mjs'].\nmodule.exports = neutrino => {\n  // if not specified, defaults to ['js', 'jsx', 'vue', 'ts', 'tsx', 'mjs']\n  neutrino.options.extensions;\n\n  // overwrites the default list\n  neutrino.options.extensions = ['elm']\n}\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  options: {\n    // extends the default list to ['js', 'jsx', 'vue', 'ts', 'tsx', 'mjs', 'elm']\n    extensions: ['elm']\n  }\n};\n\nLoader and Babel modules\nBecause of package conflicts or unknown layout of a project's node_modules directory, it is usually safer to\ndefine loaders, Babel plugins, and Babel presets to webpack absolutely than by name. In our sample preset above, while\nwe could have passed the loader as just 'standard-loader', it is safer to resolve its location relative to our preset\nthan having webpack et al attempt to load it later from a different, potentially incorrect location. Instead we\npassed require.resolve('standard-loader').\nAs a rule of thumb, if your preset is the one using require, you are safe to require by name. If you are passing the\nname of the module off to be required by webpack or Babel, instead pass the path to the module via require.resolve.\nPublishing\nWhen your preset is ready to be used by others, feel free to publish and distribute! By putting your preset on npm,\nGitHub, or another location, you can share the hard work put into abstracting away configuration and save everyone\nin the community time and effort. As long as the Neutrino CLI or another preset can require your preset, it puts no\nrestrictions on where you want to host it.\n"},"migration-guide.html":{"url":"migration-guide.html","title":"Migration Guide","keywords":"","body":"Migration Guide\nContents\n\nNeutrino v7 to v8\nNeutrino v6 to v7\nNeutrino v5 to v6\nNeutrino v4 to v5\n\nNeutrino v7 to v8\nNeutrino v8 introduces a number of changes, with some of them being breaking changes.

The core neutrino package\nremains available as is.\nBREAKING CHANGE Removed entry option in order to support multiple main entry points via new mains options.\nSee Customization for usage of mains in\n.neutrinorc.js. See API for usage of mains from the API.\n(#487)\nBREAKING CHANGE *.css files in mains chunks are no longer inlined into the JS bundle by default.\nThey are moved into a separate CSS file. To disable CSS extraction, pass options.extract = false to\nthe style-loader middleware, or options.style.extract = false to the web preset.\n(#443)\nBREAKING CHANGE There is no longer a plugin named minify when using the minify middleware. This is due\nto the minify middleware now being a composition of three different middleware. The associated plugins are\nbabel-minify, style-minify, and image-minify, from their associated individual middleware, which can also be\nused separately.\nBREAKING CHANGE The Karma preset now uses Headless Chrome by default to run tests. To that end,\nyou will need Chrome 60+ installed. (#283)\nBREAKING CHANGE The API methods .call() and .run() no longer accept additional middleware to load\nprior to running their registered handler. If you wish to load middleware prior, use the .use() method first.\nAlso, these methods no longer automatically load .neutrinorc.js either, you must load this using .use() as well.\n(#425)\n(#424)\nFor a concrete example, .eslintrc.js, which utilizes these changes, would migrate to the following:\n\nconst { Neutrino } = require('neutrino');\n\nmodule.exports = Neutrino({ root: __dirname })\n  .use('.neutrinorc.js')\n  .call('eslintrc');\n\n\nBREAKING CHANGE When building, file-loader and url-loader will generate file names with pattern\n[name].[hash].[ext] instead of [hash].[ext]. (#435)\nBREAKING CHANGE The web preset no longer uses the script-ext plugin. It was never functional and did not\nserve a purpose at this time. (#500)\n\nMigrated Packages\n\n\n\nDeprecated Preset/Middleware\nNew Scoped Package\n\n\n\n\nneutrino-middleware-banner\n@neutrinojs/banner\n\n\nneutrino-middleware-chunk\n@neutrinojs/chunk\n\n\nneutrino-middleware-clean\n@neutrinojs/clean\n\n\nneutrino-middleware-compile-loader\n@neutrinojs/compile-loader\n\n\nneutrino-middleware-copy\n@neutrinojs/copy\n\n\nneutrino-middleware-dev-server\n@neutrinojs/dev-server\n\n\nneutrino-middleware-env\n@neutrinojs/env\n\n\nneutrino-middleware-eslint\n@neutrinojs/eslint\n\n\nneutrino-middleware-font-loader\n@neutrinojs/font-loader\n\n\nneutrino-middleware-hot\n@neutrinojs/hot\n\n\nneutrino-middleware-html-loader\n@neutrinojs/html-loader\n\n\nneutrino-middleware-html-template\n@neutrinojs/html-template\n\n\nneutrino-middleware-image-loader\n@neutrinojs/image-loader\n\n\nneutrino-middleware-loader-merge\n@neutrinojs/loader-merge\n\n\nneutrino-middleware-minify\n@neutrinojs/minify\n\n\nneutrino-middleware-pwa\n@neutrinojs/pwa\n\n\nneutrino-middleware-start-server\n@neutrinojs/start-server\n\n\nneutrino-middleware-style-loader\n@neutrinojs/style-loader\n\n\nneutrino-preset-airbnb-base\n@neutrinojs/airbnb-base\n\n\nneutrino-preset-jest\n@neutrinojs/jest\n\n\nneutrino-preset-karma\n@neutrinojs/karma\n\n\nneutrino-preset-mocha\n@neutrinojs/mocha\n\n\nneutrino-preset-node\n@neutrinojs/node\n\n\nneutrino-preset-react\n@neutrinojs/react\n\n\nneutrino-preset-web\n@neutrinojs/web\n\n\n\nNeutrino v6 to v7\nNeutrino v7 introduces some changes, most of which are from major version bumps of dependent packages.\nTo upgrade from Neutrino v6 to v7, be sure to check this list for tasks you may need to perform to use\nthis latest version:\n\nBREAKING CHANGE webpack-chain upgraded to v4. The breakage from this upgrade is the .noParse method\nwhich is now a plain shortcut method, allowing you to set any value.\nBREAKING CHANGE webpack upgraded to v3. While most users should need no changes for this upgrade, be\naware that it may still be possible for something to change during this upgrade.\nBREAKING CHANGE The Web and React presets no longer include babel-polyfill by default, and have removed\nthe polyfill.babel option. If you need babel-polyfill in your app, please import it.\nBREAKING CHANGE ESLint has been upgraded to v4, which may bring linting configuration\nchanges.\nBREAKING CHANGE The Neutrino static option has been removed. The Web, React, and Node.js presets will\nstill copy files from a src/static directory if it exists, but you can override your own\ncopying directives using the neutrino-middleware-copy middleware.\nBREAKING CHANGE Certain processes like minification or starting the dev server used to happen during many\ndifferent values for the NODE_ENV environment variable. These are now controlled to run during\ncertain NODE_ENV values like production or development, or when using certain commands like\nstart or build. Look at the documentation for your specific presets to determine what environments or\ncommands are used for certain configuration changes.\nBREAKING CHANGE The minify plugin has switched to using the BabelMinifyWebpackPlugin, so the middleware\noptions have been renamed from babili to minify and from overrides to plugin,\ne.g. neutrino.use(minify, { minify: {}, plugin: {} }) or ['neutrino-middleware-minify', { minify: {}, plugin: {} }].\n\nNeutrino v5 to v6\nNeutrino v6 introduces a number of changes, with some of them being breaking changes. To upgrade from Neutrino v5\nto v6, be sure to check this list for tasks you may need to perform to use this latest version:\n\nBREAKING CHANGE Neutrino overrides and configuration is no longer done from package.json, but can automatically\nbe picked up in a .neutrinorc.js file. If you want to leave your configuration in package.json until\nyou migrate completely to the RC file, put the following contents in your .neutrinorc.js file:\n\nconst pkg = require('./package.json');\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  options: pkg.neutrino.options || {},\n  use: [\n    ...(pkg.neutrino.use || []),\n    neutrino => neutrino.config.merge(pkg.neutrino.config || {})\n  ]\n};\n\nSee the documentation on .neutrinorc.js for more details on overriding configuration.\n\nBREAKING CHANGE The Web and React presets no longer include a polyfill for Buffer. This saves approximately 60KB\nof polyfills from being loaded, at the expense of using the Buffer constructor. If you need the Buffer\nconstructor or a dependency relies on it, you can override the configuration in .neutrinorc.js:\n\nneutrino.config.node.set('Buffer', true)\n\n\nBREAKING CHANGE Neutrino no longer relies on HOST, PORT, and HTTPS environment variables for overriding\nthe webpack-dev-server settings, respectively. You can choose to either override these from .neutrinorc.js or\na one-off basis using CLI options:\n\n// Override a preset/middleware:\nmodule.exports = {\n  use: [\n    ['neutrino-preset-react', {\n      devServer: {\n        host: '192.168.1.10',\n        port: 3000,\n        https: true\n      }\n    }]\n  ]\n};\n\n// Override all presets:\nmodule.exports = {\n  options: {\n    host: '192.168.1.10',\n    port: 3000,\n    https: true\n  }\n};\n\n# Override from CLI\nneutrino start --options.host 192.168.1.10 --options.port 3000 --options.https\n\n\nBREAKING CHANGE Setting host of 0.0.0.0 for webpack-dev-server is insecure and will not work properly. This\nis from https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/issues/887 causing a potential security issue into webpack\nusers' machines. When using host, specify your actual local IP address, and Neutrino will bind it to the public\nproperty of webpack-dev-server and set the host to 0.0.0.0 for you. Attempting to access the site from a host other\nthan specified will result in an invalid host header error.\n\nShould you absolutely need to access the site from any potential host, for example if behind a proxy or firewall,\noverride from .neutrinorc.js:\n// Override a preset/middleware\nmodule.exports = {\n  use: [\n    ['neutrino-preset-react', {\n      devServer: {\n        disableHostCheck: true\n      }\n    }]\n  ]\n};\n\n// Override configuration\nneutrino.config.devServer.disableHostCheck(true)\n\n\nBREAKING CHANGE The chunk middleware no longer includes a plugin named \"chunk\", and instead exposes several\nplugins which handle different chunking mechanisms: named-modules, named-chunks, vendor-chunk, runtime-chunk,\nand name-all.\n\nBREAKING CHANGE With the changes in chunk middleware, there is no longer a named-modules middleware for v6 since\nthis now comes with the chunk middleware.\n\nBREAKING CHANGE All non-JS assets within your source directory are not automatically copied to the output\ndirectory. A new Neutrino option for static now specifies a directory for all non-compiled/included assets, and this\ndefaults to src/static. For example, if you wanted to include some images into the build that are not imported into\nyour project, you can place them in src/static and they will be automatically copied to build/static.\n\nBREAKING CHANGE The run function from Neutrino's exports has been removed in favor of a run method on the API.\n\nBREAKING CHANGE The build, start, test, and inspect functions from Neutrino's exports no longer\ninstantiate the Neutrino API, but are now functions that are passed to the Neutrino API's run method. For example, to\nrun the build function, you can pass it via:\n\n\nconst { Neutrino, build } = require('neutrino');\n\nNeutrino()\n  .run('build', [middleware], build)\n  .fork(errorHandler, successHandler);\n\nSee the Neutrino API for details on the updated API.\n\nBREAKING CHANGE Since the Neutrino API has changed, creating a .eslintrc.js file has also changed. If you have\nyour middleware defined in .neutrinorc.js, your .eslintrc.js file can be as simple as:\n\nmodule.exports = require('neutrino/src/api')().call('eslintrc');\n\nFor a more verbose example version without .neutrinorc.js:\nconst { Neutrino } = require('neutrino');\nconst api = Neutrino();\n\nmodule.exports = api.call('eslintrc', ['neutrino-preset-airbnb-base', 'neutrino-preset-react']);\n\nBREAKING CHANGE An empty object is no longer passed as options to middleware if no options have been specified.\nDependency potential BREAKING CHANGES:\n\nbabel-core upgraded to v7.0.0\nfile-loader upgraded to v0.11.2\nfile-loader removed from html-loader middleware, switched to html-loader\nbabili-webpack-plugin upgraded to v0.1.1\ncss-loader upgraded to v0.28.4\nstyle-loader upgraded to v0.18.2\njest upgraded to v20.0.3\nreact-hot-loader upgraded to v3.0.0-beta.7\n\n\nAsync polyfills are now using fast-async instead of Babel's regenerator. The reasoning is explained in the\nfast-async README:\n\n\n'fast-async' is a Babel v6.x.x plugin that implements the ES7 keywords async and await using syntax transformation\nat compile-time, rather than generators. The main reason for using 'fast-async' as opposed to Babel's default\nimplementation of async/await is performance (https://github.com/MatAtBread/nodent#performance) - it's 3-4 times faster\nin a browser/node, and as much as 10 times faster on a mobile browsers, mainly due to avoiding generators\n(and therefore regenerator).\n\nIf you wish to disable the fast-async polyfill, you can specify it to the Web, React, and Node.js presets from\nyour .neutrinorc.js:\nmodule.exports = {\n  use: [\n    ['neutrino-preset-web', {\n      polyfills: { async: false }\n    }]\n  ]\n};\n\n\nThe React preset is now additionally Babel-compiled with transform-class-properties, and during development also\nincludes transform-es2015-classes to work around https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader/issues/313.\n\nThe Node.js preset, start-server middleware, and babel-preset-env in any middleware can be debugged with the --debug\nCLI flag or the Neutrino option debug.\n\nThe Node.js preset now compiles Babel to support Node.js LTS which has moved to v6.10 from v6.9.\n\nBabel compiles using a cacheDirectory to improve subsequent build times.\n\nThe Neutrino API now exposes generic prerun and run events which are triggered prior to at any command\nrunning, e.g. running neutrino build will trigger a prebuild, prerun, build, and run events.\n\nThe ESLint middleware now defaults to a development NODE_ENV if none is specified.\n\nConfiguration can now more easily be overridden based on the values of environment variables from .neutrinorc.js\nusing the env property. Each property within env maps to an environment variable with key-values mapping to \nenvironment values which contain further middleware. This works for any environment variable, not just NODE_ENV.\nFor example, if you wanted to include additional middleware when NODE_ENV is production:\n\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  env: {\n    NODE_ENV: {\n      production: {\n        use: ['neutrino-middleware-pwa']\n      }\n    }\n  }\n};\n\nNeutrino v4 to v5\nNeutrino v5 introduces a number of changes, with some of them being breaking changes. To upgrade from Neutrino v4\nto v5, be sure to check this list for tasks you may need to perform to use this latest version:\n\nUpdates to config for creating plugins (from webpack-chain v3 upgrade):\n\n// Creating plugins in v4\nneutrino.config\n  .plugin(name)\n  .use(WebpackPlugin, ...args)\n\n// Creating plugins in v5\nneutrino.config\n  .plugin(name)\n  .use(WebpackPlugin, args)\n\n\nUpdates to config for modifying plugins (from webpack-chain v3 upgrade):\n\n// Modifying plugins in v4\nneutrino.config\n  .plugin(name)\n  .inject((Plugin, args) => new Plugin(...newArgs))\n\n// Modifying plugins in v5\nneutrino.config\n  .plugin(name)\n  .tap(args => newArgs);\n\n\nUpdates to config for creating loaders (from webpack-chain v3 upgrade):\n\n// Creating loaders in v4\nneutrino.config.module\n  .rule('compile')\n  .loader('babel', 'babel-loader', {\n    options: {\n      plugins: ['object-rest-spread']\n    }\n  });\n\n// Creating loaders in v5\nneutrino.config.module\n  .rule('compile')\n  .use('babel')\n    .loader('babel-loader')\n    .options({ plugins: ['object-rest-spread'] });\n\n\nUpdates to config for modifying loaders (from webpack-chain v3 upgrade). The function now gets its options directly\ninstead of being nested in an object:\n\n// Modifying loaders in v4\nneutrino.config.module\n  .rule('compile')\n  .loader('babel', props => merge(props, {\n    options: {\n      plugins: ['object-rest-spread']\n    }\n  }));\n\n// Modifying loaders in v5\nneutrino.config.module\n  .rule('compile')\n    .use('babel')\n      .tap(options => merge(options, { plugins: ['object-rest-spread'] }));\n\n\nUpdates to include and exclude for rules (from webpack-chain v3). In the previous webpack-chain\npackage, include and exclude were functions where you provided paths as arguments. These are now\nChainedMaps, making them much more extensible should you need to manipulate these values:\n\n// Adding rule includes and excludes in v4\nneutrino.config.module\n  .rule('compile')\n    .include(x, y)\n    .exclude(x, y);\n\n// Adding rule includes and excludes in v5\nneutrino.config.module\n  .rule('compile')\n    .include\n      .add(x)\n      .add(y)\n      .end()\n    .exclude\n      .add(x)\n      .add(y);\n\n// You can also use .merge() to add multiple paths at once:\nneutrino.config.module\n  .rule('compile')\n    .include.merge([x, y]).end()\n    .exclude.merge([x, y]);\n\n\nSimple configuration via package.json now done from top-level neutrino object. Rename config to neutrino, and\nrename config.neutrino to neutrino.config. Presets also fall under this neutrino object. The custom object has\nbeen renamed to options.\n\n{\n  \"neutrino\": {\n    \"config\": {\n      \"entry\": {\n        \"vendor\": [\"react\"]\n      }\n    },\n    \"use\": [\n      \"neutrino-preset-react\"\n    ],\n    \"options\": {\n      \"mocha\": {\n        \"reporter\": \"nyan\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\nThe Web preset has renamed its styling rule from css to style:\n\n// v4 API for Web preset\nneutrino.config.module.rule('css')\n\n// v5 API for Web preset\nneutrino.config.module.rule('style')\n\n{\n  \"neutrino\": {\n    \"config\": {\n      \"module\": {\n        \"rule\": {\n          \"style\": {}\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\nThe Neutrino CLI has renamed --presets to --use to better reflect the usage of middleware and presets, and to\nmake the inclusion of middleware consistent with the API at neutrino.use().\nJest upgraded to v19, which changes the option testPathDirs to roots. Jest options set using\npackage.json can now only be done at neutrino.options.jest (no more package.json jest);\nLinting base is deprecated in favor of neutrino-middleware-eslint:\n\n// v4 API\nconst lint = require('neutrino-lint-base');\n\nlint(neutrino);\nneutrino.config.module\n  .rule('lint')\n  .loader('eslint', props => merge(props, { rules: { /* */ } }));\n\n// v5 API\nconst eslint = require('neutrino-middleware-eslint');\n\nneutrino.use(eslint, {\n  eslint: {\n    rules: { /* */ }\n  }\n})\n\n\nWhen using a linting preset or consuming anything with neutrino-middleware-eslint, the eslintrc() method has been\nmoved from neutrino.custom.eslintrc to neutrino.eslintrc:\n\n// v4 API\nneutrino.custom.eslintrc();\n\n// v5 API\nneutrino.eslintrc();\n\n\nThe default export of the Neutrino package is now an object with several methods, one of these being the low-level\nNeutrino API:\n\nconst { Neutrino } = require('neutrino');\n\n\nThe Neutrino API has undergone significant changes and no longer needs to be called as a constructor with new.\n\nThe Neutrino API no longer accepts preset strings as its argument. The function now accepts an options object to\nbe set at neutrino.options:\n\n\nconst { Neutrino } = require('neutrino');\nconst api = Neutrino({ mocha: { reporter: 'nyan' } });\n\napi.options.mocha.reporter // \"nyan\"\n\n\nSince the Neutrino API no longer accepts preset strings in its constructor, you must now pass presets and middleware\nas code/functions to the .use() method.\n\n// v4 API\nconst Neutrino = require('neutrino');\nconst api = new Neutrino(['neutrino-preset-node', 'neutrino-preset-mocha']);\n\n// v5 API\nconst { Neutrino } = require('neutrino');\nconst api = Neutrino();\n\napi.use(require('neutrino-preset-node'));\napi.use(require('neutrino-preset-mocha'));\n\nThis also means the API function no longer does preset module resolution. If you wish to require presets and middleware\nand have them simultaneously used, use requiresAndUses:\n// v5 API\nconst { Neutrino } = require('neutrino');\nconst api = Neutrino();\n\napi.usesAndRequires([\n  'neutrino-preset-node',\n  'neutrino-preset-mocha'\n]);\n\n\nneutrino.getWebpackOptions() has been removed in favor of the lower level to neutrino.config.toConfig().\nUsing a node target no longer skips the watcher for a builder, it now uses the webpack source watcher. This means\ncommands like neutrino start && node build are obsolete. neutrino build && node build would work to start a Node\ninstance for production-built bundles.\n\n"},"presets/":{"url":"presets/","title":"Presets","keywords":"","body":"What are presets?\nA preset is a Neutrino-compatible configuration capable of building, modifying\nthe build process, or interacting with a project as a result of building.\nNeutrino provides a few core presets to quickly get started building some popular project\ntypes, but anyone can inherit, extend, and modify these presets and tailor them to their project,\nteam, or company preferences. You can even create your own presets from scratch.\nIf you are familiar with Babel presets, Neutrino presets work similarly. For example,\ngiven the Babel preset babel-preset-react, you can compile React code with JSX\nto vanilla JavaScript calls. Neutrino adopts this same concept by adapting webpack into\na tool that understands configurations-as-packages, i.e. presets. Many more aspects of\ndevelopment surround building a complete React project, for which webpack is commonly used.\nBy encapsulating the common needs of a project type into a preset, Neutrino allows you to\navoid the upfront cost of configuring and instead focus on project development.\nNot every project is the same, and oftentimes small tweaks need to be made to the build\nconfiguration in order to meet this need. Fortunately Neutrino presets can be modified and\nextended directly from the project you are building. No need to be locked in to a particular\npattern, and no escape hatches that force you into maintaining the entire configuration should\nyou need to make changes.\nPresets can be easily distributing by publishing them to npm or GitHub and installing them\nin your project. This also allows others to discover and build projects based on your own\npresets.\n"},"presets/community-presets.html":{"url":"presets/community-presets.html","title":"Community presets","keywords":"","body":"Community Presets\nA collection of Neutrino presets published on npm.

If you prefer, you can also add your preset to the\nneutrino-dev wiki.\n\n"},"middleware/":{"url":"middleware/","title":"Middleware","keywords":"","body":"Middleware\nThe basic unit of interacting with Neutrino is middleware. Middleware can modify configuration,\nlisten for events, get build metadata, or augment Neutrino with custom functionality.\nFormats\nNeutrino middleware can be specified in several different formats depending on the complexity and level of\ncustomization needed. The Neutrino API and CLI operate on the concept that they are provided a collection of middleware.\nSpecifically:\n// The Neutrino API can use many middleware when it is run()\nneutrino.run('command', [/* array of middleware */])\n\n// When no middleware has been specified to run, it defaults\n// to an array only containing the local .neutrinorc.js file\nneutrino.run('command')\n\n# The Neutrino CLI can use many middleware when running a command\n❯ neutrino command --use middleware_a middleware_b\n\n# When no middleware has been specified to the CLI, it defaults\n# to an array only containing the local .neutrinorc.js file\n❯ neutrino command\n\nEach item in these collections can be provided in a number of different formats. For example, the CLI can only directly\naccept string formats, while the API and required middleware can be of any supported format.\nThe string and array formats are generally used from within the more powerful object and function formats.\nString format\nProviding a string as a middleware item denotes it as being a require-able module. Neutrino will attempt to require\nthis string and then try to use its exports as another middleware format. For example, using the string\n\"@neutrinojs/react\" will be required by Neutrino, and then be re-processed through Neutrino using its exports as a\ndifferent middleware type, depending on what that preset exported.\nUsing the string format is most commonly used to depend on other middleware. Referencing a string does not enable\naccess to the Neutrino API, and options can only be passed to the string middleware if using the Neutrino API's use\nmethod.\n# String format on the CLI\n❯ neutrino start --use @neutrinojs/react\n\n// String format exported from other middleware\n// not very useful, but possible\nmodule.exports = '@neutrinojs/react';\n\n// String format being used within an object-format .neutrinorc.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  use: ['@neutrinojs/react']\n};\n\n// String format being used within function format\nmodule.exports = neutrino => {\n  neutrino.use('@neutrinojs/react');\n  neutrino.use('@neutrinojs/react', {\n    devServer: { port: 3000 }\n  });\n};\n\nArray format\nProviding an array as a middleware item denotes it as being a pair of middleware format and options, i.e.\n[middleware, options]. The first item in the pair can be any other middleware format, although it is typically\nspecified as a string to require, and options to be passed to the required middleware.\nUsing the array format is most commonly used to depend on other middleware while being able to supply options to the\nrequired middleware. Referencing an array does not enable access to the Neutrino API.\n// Array format exported from other middleware\n// still not very useful, but possible\nmodule.exports = ['@neutrinojs/react', { devServer: { port: 3000 } }];\n\n// Array format being used within an object-format .neutrinorc.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  use: [\n    ['@neutrinojs/react', {\n      devServer: { port: 3000 }\n    }]\n  ]\n};\n\n// Array format being used within function format\nmodule.exports = neutrino => {\n  neutrino.use(['@neutrinojs/react']);\n  neutrino.use(['@neutrinojs/react', {\n    devServer: { port: 3000 }\n  }]);\n};\n\nObject format\nProviding an object as a middleware item denotes it as being a more complex middleware structure capable of\noverriding configuration and options. The object format is the recommended format when creating .neutrinorc.js files\nas it provides a good balance between easily setting options and using other middleware. The object format can be\nstructured as follows:\nmodule.exports = {\n  // specify options to override in the Neutrino API\n  options: {\n    // for example, change the output directory to dist\n    output: 'dist',\n    // or set the default development port to 3000\n    port: 3000\n  },\n\n  // Specify environment-specific changes. This is a key-value\n  // mapping of environment variable names to their matching values\n  // during which to override. The matching environment value can\n  // be any middleware format\n  env: {\n    NODE_ENV: {\n      // Require minify middleware during production\n      production: '@neutrinojs/minify',\n\n      // Use dev-server during development\n      development: ['@neutrinojs/dev-server', { port: 3000 }],\n\n      // Use Jest during test-only\n      test: {\n        use: ['@neutrinojs/jest']\n      }\n    },\n\n    CSS_MODULES: {\n      // Turn on CSS modules when the environment variable CSS_MODULES=enable\n      enable: (neutrino) => {\n        neutrino.config.module\n          .rule('style')\n            .use('css')\n              .options({ modules: true });\n      }\n    }\n  },\n\n  // The \"use\" array defines another set of middleware for Neutrino to use.\n  // Just like the CLI and API start with a collection of middleware to use,\n  // providing a \"use\" array specifies another list of middleware formats to work with\n  use: [\n    // string format\n    '@neutrinojs/airbnb-base',\n\n    // array format\n    ['@neutrinojs/react', { polyfills: { async: false } }],\n\n    // function format\n    (neutrino) => {\n      // Make whatever configuration overrides needed\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nHopefully it is clear that the object format is quite powerful, and although it doesn't give you direct access to the\nNeutrino API, providing a function format within does give you API access.\nFunction format\nThe most powerful middleware format. Using a function as middleware gives direct access to the Neutrino API, configuration,\noptions, and events for modification, as well as being able to accept options for driving the behavior of the middleware.\nfunction middleware(neutrino, options) {}\n\nA middleware function can optionally accept an options argument which will be fed back into\nthe middleware function when used. The options argument can be whatever value you accept.\nIf you're familiar with middleware from the Express/connect world, this works similarly. When using Express middleware,\nyou provide a function to Express which receives arguments to modify a request or response along its lifecycle. There\ncan be a number of middleware functions that Express can load, each one potentially modifying a request or response in\nsuccession. Neutrino will execute middleware functions similarly, where each function successively interacts with Neutrino along\nthe lifecycle.\nTo use a concrete example, let's create middleware that adds an environment plugin:\nconst { Neutrino } = require('neutrino');\nconst { EnvironmentPlugin } = require('webpack');\n\nmodule.exports = (neutrino, additionalVars = []) => {\n  neutrino.config\n    .plugin('env')\n    .use(EnvironmentPlugin, ['NODE_ENV', ...additionalVars]);\n};\n\n// When this middleware gets used, options can be passed to it\n// depending on the format:\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  use: [\n    'your-env-middleware',\n\n    ['your-env-middleware', ['CSS_MODULES']],\n\n    (neutrino) => neutrino.use('your-env-middleware', ['CSS_MODULES'])\n  ]\n};\n\nLoading middleware\nAdditional middleware can also be loaded from a middleware function. This makes their composition simpler for\nconsumers.\n// @neutrinojs/env\nconst { EnvironmentPlugin } = require('webpack');\n\nmodule.exports = (neutrino, additionalVars = []) => neutrino.config\n  .plugin('env')\n  .use(EnvironmentPlugin, ['NODE_ENV', ...additionalVars]);\n\n// env preset (which is also middleware)\nconst env = require('@neutrinojs/env');\n\nmodule.exports = neutrino => {\n  neutrino.use(env, ['SECRET_KEY']);\n  neutrino.use(/* next middleware */);\n  neutrino.use(/* next middleware */)\n};\n\nConfiguring\nIf your middleware requires configuration outside of the options necessary for running the middleware,\nuse a closure technique for simplifying this for your middleware consumers. In short, your module will provide a\nfunction to consumers which, when executed, will return a Neutrino middleware function. Describing this in code:\nmodule.exports = function wrapper(...args) {\n  return function middleware(neutrino, options) {\n    // do something with neutrino, options, and args\n  };\n};\n\nLet's create a contrived example using our env middleware. Let's use a closure to let the consumer provide an\nalternate plugin name when creating the middleware:\n// @neutrinojs/env\nconst { EnvironmentPlugin } = require('webpack');\n\nmodule.exports = (pluginName = 'env') => (neutrino, additionalVars = []) => {\n    neutrino.config\n      .plugin(pluginName)\n      .use(EnvironmentPlugin, ['NODE_ENV', ...additionalVars]);\n};\n\n// react preset (which is also middleware)\nconst env = require('@neutrinojs/env');\n\nmodule.exports = neutrino => {\n  neutrino.use(env('ENV-PLUGIN'), ['SECRET_KEY']);\n};\n\nDistributing\nIf you would like your middleware to be used by others, feel free to publish and distribute! By putting your middleware\non npm, GitHub, or another location, you can share the hard work put into abstracting away Neutrino and webpack\ninteractions and save everyone in the community time and effort. As long as the Neutrino CLI, other middleware, or\npresets can require your middleware, it puts no restrictions on where you want to host it.\nCore middleware\nNeutrino maintains a number of core middleware packages which aid in creating the various preset packages we also\ndistribute. Continue onward for documentation on these various middleware packages.\n"},"middleware/community-middleware.html":{"url":"middleware/community-middleware.html","title":"Community middleware","keywords":"","body":"Community Middleware\nA collection of Neutrino middleware published on npm.

This\nmeans that by default all project source code should live in a directory named src in the root of the\nproject. This includes JavaScript files, CSS stylesheets, images, and any other assets that would be available\nto your compiled project.\nQuickstart\nThe fastest way to get started is by using the create-project scaffolding tool.\nDon’t want to use the CLI helper? No worries, we have you covered with the manual installation.\ncreate-project\nRun the following command to start the process. Substitute  with the directory name you wish to create\nfor this project.\nYarn\n❯ yarn create @neutrinojs/project \nNote: The create command is a shorthand that helps you do two things at once. See the Yarn create docs for more details.\nnpm/npx\nnpx comes pre-installed with npm. If you’re running an older version of npm, then\nnpm install -g npm to update to the latest version.\n❯ npx @neutrinojs/create-project \nThe CLI helper will prompt for the project to scaffold, and will offer to set\nup a test runner as well as linting to your project. Refer to the Create new project section\nfor details on all available options.\nManual Installation\nAfter installing Neutrino and the Web preset, add a new directory named src in the root of the project, with\na single JS file named index.js in it.\n❯ mkdir src && touch src/index.js\n\nThis Web preset exposes an element in the page with an ID of root to which you can mount your application. Edit\nyour src/index.js file with the following:\nconst app = document.createElement('main');\nconst text = document.createTextNode('Hello world!');\n\napp.appendChild(text);\ndocument.getElementById('root').appendChild(app);\n\nNow edit your project's package.json to add commands for starting and building the application:\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"start\": \"neutrino start --use @neutrinojs/web\",\n    \"build\": \"neutrino build --use @neutrinojs/web\"\n  }\n}\n\nIf you are using .neutrinorc.js, add this preset to your use array instead of --use flags:\nmodule.exports = {\n  use: ['@neutrinojs/web']\n};\n\nStart the app, then open a browser to the address in the console:\nYarn\n❯ yarn start\n✔ Development server running on: http://localhost:5000\n✔ Build completed\n\nnpm\n❯ npm start\n✔ Development server running on: http://localhost:5000\n✔ Build completed\n\nBuilding\n@neutrinojs/web builds static assets to the build directory by default when running neutrino build. Using the\nquick start example above as a reference:\n❯ yarn build\n\n✔ Building project completed\nHash: 2e1191cdf700df46370d\nVersion: webpack 3.5.6\nTime: 4145ms\n                           Asset       Size    Chunks             Chunk Names\n   index.523b6da56c6363aaf056.js    10.1 kB     index  [emitted]  index\n runtime.ce4090a4e87f82940ff0.js    1.51 kB   runtime  [emitted]  runtime\n                      index.html  846 bytes            [emitted]\n\nYou can either serve or deploy the contents of this build directory as a static site.\nStatic assets\nIf you wish to copy files to the build directory that are not imported from application code, you can place\nthem in a directory within src called static. All files in this directory will be copied from src/static\nto build/static. To change this behavior, specify your own patterns with\n@neutrinojs/copy.\nPaths\nThe @neutrinojs/web preset loads assets relative to the path of your application by setting webpack's\noutput.publicPath to ./. If you wish to load\nassets instead from a CDN, or if you wish to change to an absolute path for your application, customize your build to\noverride output.publicPath. See the Customizing section below.\nPreset options\nYou can provide custom options and have them merged with this preset's default options to easily affect how this\npreset builds. You can modify Web preset settings from .neutrinorc.js by overriding with an options object. Use\nan array pair instead of a string to supply these options in .neutrinorc.js.\nThe following shows how you can pass an options object to the Web preset and override its options:\nmodule.exports = {\n  use: [\n    ['@neutrinojs/web', {\n      // Change options for @neutrinojs/env\n      env: [],\n\n      // Enables Hot Module Replacement. Set to false to disable\n      hot: true,\n\n      polyfills: {\n        // Enables fast-async polyfill. Set to false to disable\n        async: true\n      },\n\n      // Sets webpack's `output.publicPath` and\n      // `devServer.publicPath` settings. Useful if you want to\n      // serve assets from a non-root location (e.g. `/assets/`)\n      publicPath: './',\n\n      // Change options for @neutrinojs/style-loader\n      style: {\n        // Disabling options.hot will also disable style.hot\n        hot: true,\n        // Extract CSS to a separate file in production.\n        extract: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'\n      },\n\n      // Change options for @neutrinojs/font-loader\n      font: {},\n\n      // Change options for @neutrinojs/image-loader\n      image: {},\n\n      // Change options for @neutrinojs/minify\n      minify: {\n        babel: {},\n        style: {},\n        image: false\n      },\n\n      // Change options for `webpack-manifest-plugin`\n      manifest: {},\n\n      // Change options related to generating the HTML document\n      // See @neutrinojs/html-template for the defaults\n      // used by the Web preset\n      html: {},\n\n      // Change options related to starting a webpack-dev-server\n      devServer: {\n        // Disabling options.hot will also disable devServer.hot\n        hot: options.hot,\n        // Proxy requests that don't match a known file to the specified backend.\n        proxy: 'https://localhost:8000/api/'\n      },\n\n      // Target specific browsers with babel-preset-env\n      targets: {\n        browsers: [\n          'last 1 Chrome versions',\n          'last 1 Firefox versions'\n        ]\n      },\n\n      // Add additional Babel plugins, presets, or env options\n      babel: {\n        // Override options for babel-preset-env:\n        presets: [\n          ['babel-preset-env', {\n            modules: false,\n            useBuiltIns: true,\n            exclude: ['transform-regenerator', 'transform-async-to-generator'],\n          }]\n        ]\n      }\n    }]\n  ]\n};\n\nExample: Disable Hot Module Replacement and change the page title:\nmodule.exports = {\n  use: [\n    ['@neutrinojs/web', {\n      /* preset options */\n\n      // Example: disable Hot Module Replacement\n      hot: false,\n\n      // Example: disable image-loader, style-loader, font-loader,\n      // font-loader, webpack-manifest-plugin\n      image: false,\n      style: false,\n      font: false,\n      manifest: false,\n\n      // Example: Remove console and debugger from output\n      minify: {\n        babel: {\n          removeConsole: true,\n          removeDebugger: true,\n        }\n      },\n\n      // Example: Use a .browserslistrc file with babel-env\n      targets: {\n        browsers: require('browserslist')()\n      },\n\n      // Remove the contents of the output directory prior to building.\n      // Set to false to disable cleaning this directory\n      clean: {\n        paths: [neutrino.options.output]\n      },\n\n      // Example: change the page title\n      html: {\n        title: 'Epic Web App'\n      },\n\n      // Example: Proxy webpack-dev-server requests to http://localhost:3000\n      devServer: {\n        proxy: 'http://localhost:3000'\n      }\n    }]\n  ]\n};\n\nDev Server Proxy\nIf you are handling requests with a server, you may want to set up a proxy for development. See webpack's devServer.proxy for all available options.\nOptionally, you may pass a url string (instead of an object) to devServer.proxy.\nThis will proxy all requests through the given url, and set some sensible defaults.\nFor example:\n['@neutrinojs/web', {\n  devServer: {\n    proxy: 'http://localhost:3000'\n  }\n}\n\nIs equivalent to:\n['@neutrinojs/web', {\n  devServer: {\n    proxy: {\n      '**': {\n        target: 'http://localhost:3000',\n        changeOrigin: true,\n        headers: {\n          'X-Dev-Server-Proxy': 'http://localhost:3000'\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nThe X-Dev-Server-Proxy header can be useful for detecting if your existing app is being requested through the proxy.\nHot Module Replacement\nWhile @neutrinojs/web supports Hot Module Replacement your app, it does require some application-specific changes\nin order to operate. Your application should define split points for which to accept modules to reload using\nmodule.hot:\nFor example:\nimport app from './app';\n\ndocument\n  .getElementById('root')\n  .appendChild(app('Hello world!'));\n\nif (module.hot) {\n  module.hot.accept('./app');\n}\n\nOr for all paths:\nimport app from './app';\n\ndocument\n  .getElementById('root')\n  .appendChild(app('Hello world!'));\n\nif (module.hot) {\n  module.hot.accept();\n}\n\nUsing dynamic imports with import() will automatically create split points and hot replace those modules upon\nmodification during development.\nCustomizing\nTo override the build configuration, start with the documentation on customization.\n@neutrinojs/web creates some conventions to make overriding the configuration easier once you are ready to make\nchanges.\nBy default Neutrino, and therefore this preset, creates a single main index entry point to your application, and\nthis maps to the index.* file in the src directory. The extension is resolved by webpack. This value is provided by\nneutrino.options.mains at neutrino.options.mains.index. This means that the Web preset is optimized toward the use\ncase of single-page applications over multi-page applications. If you wish to output multiple pages, you can detail\nall your mains in your .neutrinorc.js.\nmodule.exports = {\n  options: {\n    mains: {\n      index: 'index', // outputs index.html from src/index.*\n      admin: 'admin', // outputs admin.html from src/admin.*\n      account: 'user' // outputs account.html from src/user.*\n    }\n  },\n  use: ['@neutrinojs/web']\n}\n\nRules\nThe following is a list of rules and their identifiers which can be overridden:\n\n\n\nName\nDescription\nEnvironments and Commands\n\n\n\n\ncompile\nCompiles JS files from the src directory using Babel.

See the\nWeb documentation for specific options you can override with this object.\nmodule.exports = {\n  use: [\n    ['@neutrinojs/react', {\n      /* preset options */\n\n      // Example: disable Hot Module Replacement\n      hot: false,\n\n      // Example: change the page title\n      html: {\n        title: 'Epic React App'\n      },\n\n      // Target specific browsers with babel-preset-env\n      targets: {\n        browsers: [\n          'last 1 Chrome versions',\n          'last 1 Firefox versions'\n        ]\n      },\n\n      // Add additional Babel plugins, presets, or env options\n      babel: {\n        // Override options for babel-preset-env:\n        presets: [\n          ['babel-preset-env', {\n            modules: false,\n            useBuiltIns: true,\n            exclude: ['transform-regenerator', 'transform-async-to-generator'],\n          }]\n        ]\n      }\n    }]\n  ]\n};\n\nCustomizing\nTo override the build configuration, start with the documentation on customization.\n@neutrinojs/react does not use any additional named rules, loaders, or plugins that aren't already in use by the\nWeb preset. See the Web documentation customization\nfor preset-specific configuration to override.\nFor details on merging and overriding Babel configuration, such as supporting decorator syntax, read more\nabout using the compile-loader merge once you\nare comfortable customizing your build.\nAdvanced configuration\nBy following the customization guide and knowing the rule, loader, and plugin IDs from\n@neutrinojs/web, you can override and augment the build by providing a function to your .neutrinorc.js use\narray. You can also make these changes from the Neutrino API in custom middleware.\nBy default Neutrino, and therefore this preset, creates a single main index entry point to your application, and\nthis maps to the index.* file in the src directory. The extension is resolved by webpack. This value is provided by\nneutrino.options.mains at neutrino.options.mains.index. This means that the Web preset is optimized toward the use\ncase of single-page applications over multi-page applications. If you wish to output multiple pages, you can detail\nall your mains in your .neutrinorc.js.\nmodule.exports = {\n  options: {\n    mains: {\n      index: 'index', // outputs index.html from src/index.*\n      admin: 'admin', // outputs admin.html from src/admin.*\n      account: 'user' // outputs account.html from src/user.*\n    }\n  },\n  use: ['@neutrinojs/react']\n}\n\nVendoring\nBy defining an entry point named vendor you can split out external dependencies into a chunk separate\nfrom your application code.\nExample: Put React and React DOM into a separate \"vendor\" chunk:\nmodule.exports = {\n  use: [\n    '@neutrinojs/react',\n    (neutrino) => neutrino.config\n      .entry('vendor')\n        .add('react')\n        .add('react-dom')\n  ]\n};\n\nHot Module Replacement\nWhile @neutrinojs/react supports Hot Module Replacement your app using React Hot Loader, it does require some\napplication-specific changes in order to operate.\nFirst, install react-hot-loader as a dependency, this must be React Hot Loader v3+:\nYarn\n❯ yarn add react-hot-loader\n\nnpm\n❯ npm install --save react-hot-loader\n\n\nFrom your main entry point (defaults to src/index.* from neutrino.options.mains.index), import an AppContainer\nfrom react-hot-loader. The main file may be named index.js or index.jsx. The extension is resolved by webpack.\n\nWrap your top-level React component in the AppContainer.\nPerform the application render in a reusable function for initial load and subsequent reloads.\nAdd the hot acceptance to call this function.\n\nFor example:\nimport { render } from 'react-dom';\nimport { AppContainer } from 'react-hot-loader';\nimport MyApp from './MyApp';\n\nconst load = () => render((\n  \n    \n  \n), document.getElementById('root'));\n\nif (module.hot) {\n  module.hot.accept('./MyApp', load);\n}\n\nload();\n\nContributing\nThis preset is part of the neutrino-dev repository, a monorepo\ncontaining all resources for developing Neutrino and its core presets and middleware.

Also when\npublishing your project to npm, consider excluding your src directory by using the files property to whitelist\nbuild, or via .npmignore to blacklist src.\n{\n  \"main\": \"build/index.js\",\n  \"files\": [\n    \"build\"\n  ]\n}\n\nNote: While this preset works well for many types of Node.js applications, it's important to make the distinction\nbetween applications and libraries. This preset will not work optimally out of the box for creating distributable\nlibraries, and will take a little extra customization to make them suitable for that purpose.\nHot Module Replacement\nWhile @neutrinojs/node supports Hot Module Replacement for your app, it does require some application-specific\nchanges in order to operate. Your application should define split points for which to accept modules to reload using\nmodule.hot:\nFor example:\nimport { createServer } from 'http';\nimport app from './app';\n\nif (module.hot) {\n  module.hot.accept('./app');\n}\n\ncreateServer((req, res) => {\n  res.end(app('example'));  \n}).listen(/* */);\n\nOr for all paths:\nimport { createServer } from 'http';\nimport app from './app';\n\nif (module.hot) {\n  module.hot.accept();\n}\n\ncreateServer((req, res) => {\n  res.end(app('example'));  \n}).listen(/* */);\n\nUsing dynamic imports with import() will automatically create split points and hot replace those modules upon\nmodification during development.\nDebugging\nYou can start the Node.js server in inspect mode to debug the process by setting neutrino.options.debug to true.\nThis can be done from the API or the CLI using --debug.\nPreset options\nYou can provide custom options and have them merged with this preset's default options to easily affect how this\npreset builds. You can modify Node.js preset settings from .neutrinorc.js by overriding with an options object. Use\nan array pair instead of a string to supply these options in .neutrinorc.js.\nThe following shows how you can pass an options object to the Node.js preset and override its options, showing the\ndefaults:\nmodule.exports = {\n  use: [\n    ['@neutrinojs/node', {\n      // Enables Hot Module Replacement. Set to false to disable\n      hot: true,\n\n      polyfills: {\n        // Enables fast-async polyfill. Set to false to disable\n        async: true\n      },\n\n      // Target specific versions via babel-preset-env\n      targets: {\n        node: '6.10'\n      },\n\n      // Remove the contents of the output directory prior to building.\n      // Set to false to disable cleaning this directory\n      clean: {\n        paths: [neutrino.options.output]\n      },\n\n      // Add additional Babel plugins, presets, or env options\n      babel: {\n        // Override options for babel-preset-env, showing defaults:\n        presets: [\n          ['babel-preset-env', {\n            targets: { node: '6.10' },\n            modules: false,\n            useBuiltIns: true,\n            // These are excluded when using polyfills.async. Disabling the async polyfill\n            // will remove these from the exclusion list\n            exclude: ['transform-regenerator', 'transform-async-to-generator']\n          }]\n        ]\n      }\n    }]\n  ]\n};\n\nExample: Override the Node.js Babel compilation target to Node.js v8:\nmodule.exports = {\n  use: [\n    ['@neutrinojs/node', {\n      // Add additional Babel plugins, presets, or env options\n      babel: {\n        // Override options for babel-preset-env\n        presets: [\n          ['babel-preset-env', {\n            // Passing in targets to babel-preset-env will replace them\n            // instead of merging them\n            targets: {\n              node: '8.0'\n            }\n          }]\n        ]\n      }\n    }]\n  ]\n};\n\nCustomizing\nTo override the build configuration, start with the documentation on customization.\n@neutrinojs/node creates some conventions to make overriding the configuration easier once you are ready to make\nchanges.\nBy default Neutrino, and therefore this preset, creates a single main index entry point to your application, and this\nmaps to the index.* file in the src directory. This means that this preset is optimized toward a single main entry\nto your application. Code not imported in the hierarchy of the index entry will not be output to the bundle. To overcome\nthis you must either define more mains via options.mains, import the code path\nsomewhere along the index hierarchy, or define multiple configurations in your .neutrinorc.js.\nVendoring\nThis preset automatically vendors all external dependencies into a separate chunk based on their inclusion in your\npackage.json. No extra work is required to make this work.\nRules\nThe following is a list of rules and their identifiers which can be overridden:\n\n\n\nName\nDescription\nEnvironments and Commands\n\n\n\n\ncompile\nCompiles JS files from the src directory using Babel. Contains a single loader named babel\nall\n\n\n\nPlugins\nThe following is a list of plugins and their identifiers which can be overridden:\nNote: Some plugins are only available in certain environments.

You can also\nmake these changes from the Neutrino API in custom middleware.\nExample: Allow importing modules with a .esm extension.\nmodule.exports = {\n  use: [\n    '@neutrinojs/node',\n    (neutrino) => neutrino.config.resolve.extensions.add('.esm')\n  ]\n};\n\nContributing\nThis preset is part of the neutrino-dev repository, a monorepo\ncontaining all resources for developing Neutrino and its core presets and middleware.

To overcome\nthis you must either define more mains via options.mains, import\nthe code path somewhere along the index hierarchy, or define multiple configurations in your .neutrinorc.js.\nExternal dependencies\nThis preset automatically marks all dependencies as external to your library, meaning that\nany dependencies you import will not be bundled with your library. This helps prevent\nyour library from bloating, but means users of your library will be installing or using\nyour dependencies as defined in package.json. You can override this in the library preset\noptions by passing further options to the externals property. This accepts an options\nobject format defined by\nwebpack-node-externals,\nto which you can provide a whitelist value.\nThe whitelist will override which dependencies are bundled in your library. Any dependency\nnot matched by this whitelist is considered a peer of your library, and will not be bundled.\nExample: The following example library redux-example has the following package.json, marking\nredux and mitt as dependencies, but only lists mitt in whitelist. This bundles mitt along\nwith the library, so the library consumer does not need to explicitly import/require/script it prior.\nThe redux dependency is not in the whitelist, so it will not be bundled, and is considered a peer\nof redux-example.\n{\n  \"name\": \"redux-example\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n  \"main\": \"build/reduxExample.js\",\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"build\": \"neutrino build\"\n  },\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"mitt\": \"*\",\n    \"redux\": \"*\"\n  },\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"neutrino\": \"*\",\n    \"@neutrinojs/library\": \"*\"\n  }\n}\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  use: [\n    ['@neutrinojs/library', {\n      name: 'reduxExample',\n      externals: {\n        whitelist: ['mitt']\n      }\n    }]\n  ]\n};\n\n// ES imports\nimport { createStore } from 'redux';\nimport reduxExample from 'redux-example';\n\n// CJS require\nconst { createStore } = require('redux');\nconst reduxExample = require('redux-example');\n\n// AMD require\nrequire(['redux', 'redux-example'], ({ createStore }, reduxExample) => {\n  // ...\n});\n\n\n\n\n\n  const { createStore } = window.redux;\n  window.reduxExample // ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  const { createStore } = window.redux;\n  window.reduxExample // ...\n\n\nGenerating multiple builds\nThe @neutrinojs/library middleware can be used in conjunction with the\n@neutrinojs/fork middleware to generate multiple library outputs\nwhen building. Follow the instructions to install the fork middleware, and change your .neutrinorc.js\nformat as follows:\nconst name = 'Logger';\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  use: [\n    (neutrino) => {\n      neutrino.on('prebuild', () => neutrino.use('@neutrinojs/clean'));\n    },\n    ['@neutrinojs/fork', {\n      configs: {\n        // Create a named entry for each build type.\n        // You will most likely want to disable cleaning\n        // the output directory until prior to building\n        umd: ['@neutrinojs/library', { name, clean: false }],\n        commonjs2: ['@neutrinojs/library', { name, clean: false }]\n      }\n    }]\n  ]\n};\n\nCustomizing\nTo override the build configuration, start with the documentation on customization.\n@neutrinojs/library creates some conventions to make overriding the configuration easier once you are ready to make\nchanges.\nBy default Neutrino, and therefore this preset, creates a single main index entry point to your library, and this\nmaps to the index.* file in the src directory.

This is a limitation of ESLint, not this\nmiddleware.\nOverride configuration\nBy following the customization guide and knowing the rule and loader IDs above,\nyou can also override or augment the build by providing a function to your .neutrinorc.js use array. You can also\nmake this change from the Neutrino API when using the use method.\nExample: Turn off semicolons from being required as defined by the Airbnb rules from .neutrinorc.js using a function and the API:\nmodule.exports = {\n  use: [\n    '@neutrinojs/airbnb',\n    (neutrino) => neutrino.config.module\n      .rule('lint')\n      .use('eslint')\n      .tap(options => Object.assign({}, options, {\n        rules: {\n          semi: 'off'\n        }\n      }))\n  ]\n};\n\neslint CLI\nThis is the recommended way to perform a one-off lint in a Neutrino project, and is inherited from @neutrinojs/eslint.\nYou can also have Neutrino invoke ESLint for you if you wish to perform a one-time lint. This avoids needing to install\nESLint manually, creating a .eslintrc.js file, or having to manage includes and ignores. As long as the ESLint\nmiddleware is loaded, you have access to a command to run ESLint from the command line.\nThis middleware registers a command named lint which programmatically calls ESLint and prints the results to\nthe console.\n❯ neutrino lint\n\n❯ neutrino lint --fix\n\neslintrc Config\nIf you cannot or do not wish to use Neutrino to execute one-off linting, you can still use ESLint manually.\n@neutrinojs/eslint, from which this preset inherits, also provides a method for getting the ESLint\nconfiguration suitable for use in an eslintrc file. Typically this is used for providing hints or fix solutions to the\ndevelopment environment, e.g. IDEs and text editors. Doing this requires\ncreating an instance of the Neutrino API and providing the middleware it uses. If you keep all\nthis information in a .neutrinorc.js, this should be relatively straightforward. By providing all the middleware used\nto Neutrino, you can ensure all the linting options used across all middleware will be merged together for your\ndevelopment environment, without the need for copying, duplication, or loss of organization and separation.\nThis middleware registers another command named eslintrc which returns an ESLint configuration object suitable for\nconsumption by the ESLint CLI. Use the Neutrino API's call method to invoke this command:\nExample: Create a .eslintrc.js file in the root of the project, using .neutrinorc.js middleware.\n// .eslintrc.js\nconst { Neutrino } = require('neutrino');\n\n// Specify middleware to Neutrino prior to calling eslintrc.\n// Even if using .neutrinorc.js, you must specify it when using\n// the API\nmodule.exports = Neutrino({ root: __dirname })\n  .use('.neutrinorc.js')\n  .call('eslintrc');\n\nExample: Create a .eslintrc.js file in the root of the project, using specified middleware.\n// .eslintrc.js\nconst { Neutrino } = require('neutrino');\n\n// Specify middleware to Neutrino prior to calling eslintrc.\n// You can choose to not use .neutrinorc.js as the middleware to\n// use if you prefer, specifying any middleware you wish.\nmodule.exports = Neutrino({ root: __dirname })\n  .use('@neutrinojs/airbnb', {\n    eslint: {\n      rules: { semi: 'off' }\n    }\n  })\n  .use('@neutrinojs/react')\n  .call('eslintrc');\n\nIf you are able, only use a .eslintrc.js file for editor hints, and use the Neutrino lint command for one-off linting\nor fixes.\nProjects may face a problem when their editor or IDE lints all files and highlights errors that were normally excluded\nfrom source, i.e. Neutrino's include and exclude options. This is because the ESLint CLI does not have a way to\nspecify included and excluded files from configuration. If you still wish to use ESLint's CLI for linting, consider\nsetting CLI flags or using an\neslintignore to choose which files to\ninclude or exclude from linting.\nUnfortunately ESLint does not provide the possibility to configure ignored paths from Neutrino configuration and exclude them\nfrom linting. Projects authors should define this manually in their project root directory in a .eslintignore file. This\nis one of the main reasons to prefer using the lint CLI command with this middleware, as it avoids a lot of manual\nconfiguration and boilerplate.\n.eslintignore file:\n/build\n/*.*\nESLint will exclude built files and any files in the root directory (e.g. custom Neutrino configuration) but src and\ntest folders will be still checked. node_modules are ignored by default in ESLint.

Use an array pair instead of a string\nto supply these options.\nExample: Turn on semicolons as being required, as opposed to the StandardJS rules.\nmodule.exports = {\n  use: [\n    ['@neutrinojs/standardjs', {\n      eslint: {\n        rules: {\n          semi: 'error'\n        }\n      }\n    }]\n  ]\n};\n\nCustomizing\nTo override the build configuration, start with the documentation on customization.\n@neutrinojs/standardjs creates some conventions to make overriding the configuration easier once you are ready to\nmake changes.\nRules\nThe following is a list of rules and their identifiers which can be overridden:\n\n\n\nName\nDescription\nEnvironments and Commands\n\n\n\n\nlint\nLints JS and JSX files from the src directory using ESLint. Contains a single loader named eslint. This is inherited from @neutrinojs/eslint.\nall\n\n\n\nInformation\nIf you want your preset or middleware to also extend from another ESLint configuration or preset that you have made\na dependency, you must use baseConfig.extends rather than just extends. This is a limitation of ESLint, not this\nmiddleware.\nOverride configuration\nBy following the customization guide and knowing the rule and loader IDs above,\nyou can also override or augment the build by providing a function to your .neutrinorc.js use array. You can also\nmake this change from the Neutrino API when using the use method.\nExample: Turn on semicolons as being required, as opposed to the StandardJS rules, from .neutrinorc.js using a function and the API:\nmodule.exports = {\n  use: [\n    '@neutrinojs/standardjs',\n    (neutrino) => neutrino.config.module\n      .rule('lint')\n      .use('eslint')\n      .tap(options => Object.assign({}, options, {\n        rules: {\n          semi: 'error'\n        }\n      }))\n  ]\n};\n\neslint CLI\nThis is the recommended way to perform a one-off lint in a Neutrino project, and is inherited from @neutrinojs/eslint.\nYou can also have Neutrino invoke ESLint for you if you wish to perform a one-time lint. This avoids needing to install\nESLint manually, creating a .eslintrc.js file, or having to manage includes and ignores. As long as the ESLint\nmiddleware is loaded, you have access to a command to run ESLint from the command line.\nThis middleware registers a command named lint which programmatically calls ESLint and prints the results to\nthe console.\n❯ neutrino lint\n\n❯ neutrino lint --fix\n\neslintrc Config\nIf you cannot or do not wish to use Neutrino to execute one-off linting, you can still use ESLint manually.\n@neutrinojs/eslint, from which this preset inherits, also provides a method for getting the ESLint\nconfiguration suitable for use in an eslintrc file. Typically this is used for providing hints or fix solutions to the\ndevelopment environment, e.g. IDEs and text editors. Doing this requires\ncreating an instance of the Neutrino API and providing the middleware it uses. If you keep all\nthis information in a .neutrinorc.js, this should be relatively straightforward. By providing all the middleware used\nto Neutrino, you can ensure all the linting options used across all middleware will be merged together for your\ndevelopment environment, without the need for copying, duplication, or loss of organization and separation.\nThis middleware registers another command named eslintrc which returns an ESLint configuration object suitable for\nconsumption by the ESLint CLI. Use the Neutrino API's call method to invoke this command:\nExample: Create a .eslintrc.js file in the root of the project, using .neutrinorc.js middleware.\n// .eslintrc.js\nconst { Neutrino } = require('neutrino');\n\n// Specify middleware to Neutrino prior to calling eslintrc.\n// Even if using .neutrinorc.js, you must specify it when using\n// the API\nmodule.exports = Neutrino({ root: __dirname })\n  .use('.neutrinorc.js')\n  .call('eslintrc');\n\nExample: Create a .eslintrc.js file in the root of the project, using specified middleware.\n// .eslintrc.js\nconst { Neutrino } = require('neutrino');\n\nmodule.exports = Neutrino({ root: __dirname })\n  .use('@neutrinojs/standardjs', {\n    eslint: {\n      rules: { semi: 'error' }\n    }\n  })\n  .use('@neutrinojs/react')\n  .call('eslintrc');\n\nIf you are able, only use a .eslintrc.js file for editor hints, and use the Neutrino lint command for one-off linting\nor fixes.\nProjects may face a problem when their editor or IDE lints all files and highlights errors that were normally excluded\nfrom source, i.e. Neutrino's include and exclude options. This is because the ESLint CLI does not have a way to\nspecify included and excluded files from configuration. If you still wish to use ESLint's CLI for linting, consider\nsetting CLI flags or using an\neslintignore to choose which files to\ninclude or exclude from linting.\nUnfortunately ESLint does not provide the possibility to configure ignored paths from Neutrino configuration and exclude them\nfrom linting. Projects authors should define this manually in their project root directory in a .eslintignore file. This\nis one of the main reasons to prefer using the lint CLI command with this middleware, as it avoids a lot of manual\nconfiguration and boilerplate.\n.eslintignore file:\n/build\n/*.*\nESLint will exclude built files and any files in the root directory (e.g. custom Neutrino configuration) but src and\ntest folders will be still checked. node_modules are ignored by default in ESLint. More information can be found\nin the ESLint user guide.\nContributing\nThis preset is part of the neutrino-dev repository, a monorepo\ncontaining all resources for developing Neutrino and its core presets and middleware.

This is a limitation of ESLint, not this\nmiddleware.\n\nThis middleware only configures a target environment for es6, leaving other build middleware free to add their own\ntarget environments. If your middleware puts restrictions on which environments it is capable of running, please\ndocument that clearly in your middleware.\neslint CLI\nThis is the recommended way to perform a one-off lint in a Neutrino project.\nYou can also have Neutrino invoke ESLint for you if you wish to perform a one-time lint. This avoids needing to install\nESLint manually, creating a .eslintrc.js file, or having to manage includes and ignores. As long as the ESLint\nmiddleware is loaded, you have access to a command to run ESLint from the command line.\nThis middleware registers a command named lint which programmatically calls ESLint and prints the results to\nthe console.\n❯ neutrino lint\n\n❯ neutrino lint --fix\n\neslintrc Config\nIf you cannot or do not wish to use Neutrino to execute one-off linting, you can still use ESLint manually.\n@neutrinojs/eslint also provides a method for getting the ESLint configuration suitable for use in an eslintrc\nfile. Typically this is used for providing hints or fix solutions to the development environment, e.g. IDEs and text\neditors. Doing this requires creating an instance of the Neutrino API and providing the\nmiddleware it uses. If you keep all this information in a .neutrinorc.js, this should be relatively straightforward. By\nproviding all the middleware used to Neutrino, you can ensure all the linting options used across all middleware will be\nmerged together for your development environment, without the need for copying, duplication, or loss of organization and\nseparation.\nThis middleware registers another command named eslintrc which returns an ESLint configuration object suitable for\nconsumption by the ESLint CLI. Use the Neutrino API's call method to invoke this command:\nExample: Create a .eslintrc.js file in the root of the project, using .neutrinorc.js middleware.\n// .eslintrc.js\nconst { Neutrino } = require('neutrino');\n\n// Specify middleware to Neutrino prior to calling eslintrc.\n// Even if using .neutrinorc.js, you must specify it when using\n// the API\nmodule.exports = Neutrino({ root: __dirname })\n  .use('.neutrinorc.js')\n  .call('eslintrc');\n\nExample: Create a .eslintrc.js file in the root of the project, using specified middleware.\n// .eslintrc.js\nconst { Neutrino } = require('neutrino');\n\nmodule.exports = Neutrino({ root: __dirname })\n  .use('@neutrinojs/eslint', {\n    eslint: {\n      rules: { semi: 'off' }\n    }\n  })\n  .call('eslintrc');\n\nIf you are able, only use a .eslintrc.js file for editor hints, and use the Neutrino lint command for one-off linting\nor fixes. Loading ESLint configuration from .eslintrc.js that is not .neutrinorc.js or uses configuration that\ndiffers from .neutrinorc.js could lead to unintended consequences such as linting not failing or passing when expected,\nor working differently when running different commands. Closely evaluate whether you actually need to make these rule\nchanges in .eslintrc.js over .neutrinorc.js.\nProjects may face a problem when their editor or IDE lints all files and highlights errors that were normally excluded\nfrom source, i.e. Neutrino's include and exclude options. This is because the ESLint CLI does not have a way to\nspecify included and excluded files from configuration. If you still wish to use ESLint's CLI for linting, consider\nsetting CLI flags or using an\neslintignore to choose which files to\ninclude or exclude from linting.\nUnfortunately ESLint does not provide the possibility to configure ignored paths from Neutrino configuration and exclude them\nfrom linting. Projects authors should define this manually in their project root directory in a .eslintignore file.

Inside your project, make sure you have\nneutrino installed and any other Neutrino middleware are development dependencies.\nYarn\n❯ yarn add --dev @neutrinojs/fork\n\nnpm\n❯ npm install --save-dev @neutrinojs/fork\n\nDetails\n@neutrinojs/fork operates by defining which middleware you wish to split off into separate processes so they\ncan be run simultaneously. Some typical use cases:\n\nBuilding a web app and a Node.js app from the same project\nBuild multiple web apps or multiple Node.js apps from the same project\nGenerate multiple targets when building libraries\n\nThis middleware must be used in conjunction with a .neutrinorc.js file to inform Neutrino of which\nmiddleware should be split into another process. See the customization docs\nfor details on setting up a .neutrinorc.js file in your project if you do not already have one.\nImportant: The configuration options provided to the fork middleware needs to be serializable across\nNode.js processes, which is includes Strings, Numbers, Arrays, Booleans, Objects, Arrays, and more. Using\nfunctions or class instances may not be serializable across processes, such as is the case with some\nwebpack plugins. If you need to provide these to fork middleware configuration, see the section on serialization\nworkarounds below.\nQuickstart\nAfter installing Neutrino, your other build middleware, and the fork middleware, open your .neutrinorc.js file.\nFor this example, let's demonstrate building a React app and Node.js app from the same project using different source\ndirectories:\nmodule.exports = {\n  use: [\n    ['@neutrinojs/fork', {\n      configs: {\n        react: '@neutrinojs/react',\n        node: {\n          options: { source: 'server' },\n          use: ['@neutrinojs/node']\n        }\n      }\n    }]\n  ]\n};\n\nLet's examine this .neutrinorc.js file and see what is happening:\nmodule.exports = {\n  // Tell Neutrino to use the following middleware defined\n  // in this array\n  use: [\n    // Use the fork middleware to build configuration\n    // into separate processes.\n    ['@neutrinojs/fork', {\n      // Each process will be defined in \"configs\".\n      // The key in \"configs\" will be used to identify\n      // the forked process. For simplicity, we named\n      // these \"react\" and \"node\". Therefore, these 2\n      // will spawn 2 separate processes, one for the\n      // \"react\" config, and one for the \"node\" config.\n      configs: {\n        // The key in \"configs\" maps to a middleware value.\n\n        // The \"react\" config uses \"@neutrinojs/react\" as\n        // middleware using the string format. By default,\n        // the \"react\" app's source lives in src/, and builds\n        // to build/\n        react: '@neutrinojs/react',\n\n        // The \"node\" config uses the object middleware\n        // format to configure Neutrino to build this\n        // project from a different directory than the\n        // \"react\" app, using server/ instead of src/, and\n        // builds to server-build/\n        node: {\n          options: { source: 'server', output: 'server-build' },\n          use: ['@neutrinojs/node']\n        }\n      }\n    }]\n  ]\n};\n\nUpon starting or building your project, you will now see console messages labeled according to their config ID,\neach running in their own process. Quitting Neutrino will cause all forked processes to exit.\n❯ yarn start\n[react] ✔ Development server running on: http://localhost:5000\n[node] Listening on :3000\n[node] ✔ Build completed\n[react] ✔ Build completed\n\nPaths\nMost middleware attempt to follow the standard Neutrino project layout\nto output their compiled output, but building multiple projects at once is bound to cause clashes with\nthe directories each project uses. This could lead to:\n\nOne target cleaning the output of another target\nOne target replacing a file from the output of another target\n\nThis has the potential to lead to difficult bugs. As such, it is recommended to change the source and output directory\noptions to avoid this situation altogether, which the example above demonstrates. If you are certain you want from\nand to the same directories, such as when building libraries, ensure you follow any project cleanup instructions\noutlined by your middleware.\nSerialization\nThe configuration options provided to the fork middleware needs to be serializable across\nNode.js processes, which is includes Strings, Numbers, Arrays, Booleans, Objects, Arrays, and more. Using\nfunctions or class instances may not be serializable across processes, such as is the case with some\nwebpack plugins.\nFor example, let's say you wanted to consume the webpack-assets-plugin in your fork middleware options:\n// .neutrinorc.js\nconst AssetsPlugin = require('assets-webpack-plugin');\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  use: [\n    ['@neutrinojs/fork', {\n      configs: {\n        react: {\n          use: [\n            '@neutrinojs/react',\n            (neutrino) => {\n              neutrino.config\n                .plugin('asset')\n                  .use(AssetsPlugin, [/* ... */]);\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n      }\n    }]\n  ]\n};\n\nThis would not work as-is, since the middleware function consuming the AssetsPlugin would not be serializable as-is.\nTo work around this, you can move this middleware function to a separate file, and reference it in the middleware,\nwhich would then get forked and used:\n// .neutrinorc.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  use: [\n    ['@neutrinojs/fork', {\n      configs: {\n        react: {\n          use: [\n            '@neutrinojs/react',\n            'assets-middleware.js'\n          ]\n        }\n      }\n    }]\n  ]\n};\n\n// assets-middleware.js\nconst AssetsPlugin = require('assets-webpack-plugin');\n\nmodule.exports = (neutrino) => {\n  neutrino.config\n    .plugin('asset')\n      .use(AssetsPlugin, [/* ... */]);\n};\n\nEvents\nThe fork middleware creates a new instance of the Neutrino API for every process spawned.\nIn order to make use of the Neutrino events that occur in these sub-processes from the parent, Neutrino maps\nthese events using a {name}:{event} convention:\nmodule.exports = {\n  use: [\n    ['@neutrinojs/fork', {\n      configs: {\n        react: '@neutrinojs/react',\n        node: {\n          options: { source: 'server' },\n          use: ['@neutrinojs/node']\n        }\n      }\n    }],\n\n    // listen for certain events\n    (neutrino) => {\n      neutrino.on('react:build', () => { /* ... */ });\n      neutrino.on('node:start', () => { /* ... */ });\n    }\n  ]\n};\n\nContributing\nThis preset is part of the neutrino-dev repository, a monorepo\ncontaining all resources for developing Neutrino and its core presets and middleware.

Set to false to disable stylesheet extraction.\n\nCustom Loaders\nYou may wish to perform custom loading on your stylesheets by using SASS, LESS, postcss, and more. You can do this\nby providing an array of custom loaders to the loaders options to this middleware. Each item in the loaders array\ncorresponds to a webpack loader to use, and can be defined as an object  or as a string.\nUsing an object to define loaders is preferred since it allows options to be overridable in the future, and\nby other consuming middleware. Each loader object can specify 3 properties:\n\nloader: A string referencing the path to the loader to use, e.g. sass-loader or require.resolve('less-loader').\noptions: An object specifying any options needed by the loader.\nuseId: A string identified for the loader, used to reference the loader in the future for overrides or customization by other middleware.\n\nUsing a string to define loaders will cause @neutrinojs/style-loader to still generate a loader object. The string\nwill be used as the loader property, options will be left blank, and the useId will be derived from\ncssUseId option above plus the index of this loader within the loaders array.\nImportant: The useId for string-defined loaders will start at 2, since all loaders are preceded by the included\nstyle-loader and css-loader.\nmodule.exports = {\n  use: ['@neutrinojs/style-loader', {\n    loaders: [\n      // Define loaders as objects\n      {\n        loader: 'sass-loader',\n        useId: 'sass',\n        options: {\n          includePaths: ['absolute/path/a', 'absolute/path/b']\n        }\n      },\n      {\n        loader: 'postcss-loader',\n        options: {\n          plugins: [require('autoprefixer')]\n        }\n      }\n    ]\n  }]\n}\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  use: ['@neutrinojs/style-loader', {\n    loaders: [\n      // Define loaders as strings\n      // This will cause this middleware to generate a\n      // loader with a useId of `css-2`.\n      'sass-loader'\n\n      // Adding any other loaders will increment the useId\n      // to `css-3`, `css-4`, etc.\n    ]\n  }]\n}\n\nDue to the inferred loader names, we highly recommend you stick to using objects\nto define loaders.\nLoader Configuration\nYou can configure loaders directly by passing options.\nFor PostCSS, if you want to use an external config file,\nyou need to pass options.config:\n// .neutrinorc.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  use: ['@neutrinojs/style-loader', {\n    loaders: [\n      {\n        loader: 'postcss-loader',\n        useId: 'postcss',\n        options: {\n          config: {\n\n            // Where to look for config (postcss.config.js)\n            // https://github.com/postcss/postcss-loader#path\n            // See \"Loader Configuration\" below\n            path: neutrino.options.root\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    ]\n  }]\n}\n\n// .postcssrc.js\n// Example: load tailwindcss plugin\nmodule.exports = {\n  plugins: {\n    tailwindcss: {},\n  }\n};\n\nCustomization\n@neutrinojs/style-loader creates some conventions to make overriding the configuration easier once you are\nready to make changes.\nRules\nThe following is a list of default rules and their identifiers which can be overridden:\n\n\n\nName\nDescription\nEnvironments and Commands\n\n\n\n\nstyle\nAllows importing CSS stylesheets from modules.

This avoids needing to install\nstylelint manually, creating a .stylelint.js file, or having to manage includes and ignores. As long as the stylelint\nmiddleware is loaded, you have access to a command to run stylelint from the command line.\nThis middleware registers a command named stylelint which programmatically calls stylelint and prints the results to\nthe console.\n❯ neutrino stylelint\n\n❯ neutrino stylelint --fix\n\nstylelintrc Config\nIf you cannot or do not wish to use Neutrino to execute one-off linting, you can still use stylelint manually.\n@neutrinojs/stylelint also provides a method for getting the stylelint configuration suitable for use in a stylelintrc\nfile. Typically this is used for providing hints or fix solutions to the development environment, e.g. IDEs and text\neditors. Doing this requires creating an instance of the Neutrino API and providing the\nmiddleware it uses. If you keep all this information in a .neutrinorc.js, this should be relatively straightforward. By\nproviding all the middleware used to Neutrino, you can ensure all the linting options used across all middleware will be\nmerged together for your development environment, without the need for copying, duplication, or loss of organization and\nseparation.\nThis middleware registers another command named stylelintrc which returns a stylelint configuration object suitable for\nconsumption by the stylelint CLI. Use the Neutrino API's call method to invoke this command:\nExample: Create a .stylelintrc.js file in the root of the project, using .neutrinorc.js middleware.\n// .stylelintrc.js\nconst { Neutrino } = require('neutrino');\n\n// Specify middleware to Neutrino prior to calling stylelintrc.\n// Even if using .neutrinorc.js, you must specify it when using\n// the API\nmodule.exports = Neutrino({ root: __dirname })\n  .use('.neutrinorc.js')\n  .call('stylelintrc');\n\nExample: Create a .stylelintrc.js file in the root of the project, using specified middleware.\n// .stylelintrc.js\nconst { Neutrino } = require('neutrino');\n\nmodule.exports = Neutrino({ root: __dirname })\n  .use('@neutrinojs/stylelint', {\n    config: {\n      rules: { 'max-empty-lines': 2 }\n    }\n  })\n  .call('stylelint');\n\nIf you are able, only use a .stylelint.js file for editor hints, and use the Neutrino stylelint command for one-off linting\nor fixes. Loading stylelint configuration from .stylelint.js that is not .neutrinorc.js or uses configuration that\ndiffers from .neutrinorc.js could lead to unintended consequences such as linting not failing or passing when expected,\nor working differently when running different commands. Closely evaluate whether you actually need to make these rule\nchanges in .stylelint.js over .neutrinorc.js.\nContributing\nThis middleware is part of the neutrino-dev repository, a monorepo\ncontaining all resources for developing Neutrino and its core presets and middleware.

We are very happy that you want to contribute, and have put together\nthis guide to help you get started. We want to do our best to help you make successful contributions and be part of our\ncommunity.\nParticipation Conduct\nIn order to ensure everyone has a fair, pleasant, and inclusive experience contributing to Neutrino, we ask that you\nabide by our community participation guidelines, based on the\nContributor Covenant. Please read and understand it for everyone's benefit.\nFollowing these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing\nand developing Neutrino. In return, we will show you respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes,\nand helping you finalize your pull requests.\nWhat we need\nThere is always room for improvement and expansion in Neutrino. Some things that could always help:\n\nTriaging and fixing bugs\nAdding tests to Neutrino which can help ensure it functions properly with new contributions\nKeeping core presets up to date with the best webpack and Babel options\nExpanding documentation, writing tutorials, and creating example projects\nSomething else, of course!\n\nWhat we probably don't need\nWhile we are happy to review any contribution, there are some things that are best left as an external project:\n\nAdditional presets. While neutrino-dev does contain a number of core presets, we created and maintain these because\nthey were core to most of the projects we personally work on. If there are more presets you believe should be maintained\nby the core, then feel free to raise an issue and we can discuss! Most likely though, additional presets can be\nexternally maintained and published to npm. It still has the same reach potential as bringing it into the core, without\nraising the maintenance burden for Neutrino unnecessarily.\nScaffolding and boilerplates. The goal of Neutrino is to remove over-reliance on boilerplates, instead opting to\npush users into consuming presets. Neutrino itself will not add commands to scaffold out new projects or create\nboilerplate repositories. We do keep a collection of examples-as-documentation for getting started with Neutrino\npresets, but do not wish to govern project structure more than necessary. These types of projects can be maintained\nexternally.\n\nSupport\nNeutrino team members and contributors are here to help you! Should you need assistance or have questions in using\nNeutrino or its core presets, please consider asking on our Spectrum channel, Stack Overflow, or other channel rather than\nfiling issues. We would prefer to keep our GitHub issues clear for bugs, feature requests, discussions, and\nrelevant information related to its development.\n\nGuidelines\n\nPlease make a good-faith effort to ensure that code that goes into neutrino-dev follows the existing patterns and\nquality that is already present in the repository.\nCreate issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get\ncommunity feedback.\nStrive for code to be readable. Prefer following functional programming paradigms over object-oriented ones where\npossible.\nKeep feature versions as small as possible, preferably one new feature per version.\n\nGetting started\nMost contributions will involve working with the neutrino-dev codebase. Please refer to the development\ndocumentation for technical details on getting started.\nFiling bugs and issues\nWhen filing an issue, try to answer these questions:\n\nWhat version of Neutrino are you using?\nAre you trying to use any presets? If so, which ones, and what versions?\nAre you using the Yarn client or the npm client? What version?\nWhat version of Node.js are you using?\nWhat operating system are you using?\nWhat did you do?\nWhat did you expect to happen?\nWhat actually happened, contrary to your expectations?\n\nFeature Requests or Enhancements\nPlease file an issue describing your request in detail:\n\nWhat is the goal of the change?\nWhat are the pros and cons of the change?\nCould this dramatically improve the experience of our users?\n\nPlease be open to discussion, and we will respect your time by fairly evaluating your request. In the event that your\nrequest is deemed to not be acceptable to move forward, please understand that isn't a criticism of you as a person,\nbut rather that the idea in its present form may not be right at this time. We respect you and your ideas, and will\nalways encourage contributors to continue to make proposals.\nCode review process\nCode is reviewed by Neutrino team members for quality, conformance to existing patterns, and functionality.\n"},"contributing/development.html":{"url":"contributing/development.html","title":"Development Process","keywords":"","body":"Developing Neutrino\nDeveloping and contributing to Neutrino, its core presets, and middleware is done through our monorepo located at\nhttps://github.com/mozilla-neutrino/neutrino-dev.

Lines not starting\nwith this symbol show sample console output from running the previous command.\nRequirements\nDeveloping for neutrino-dev requires:\n\nNode.js v6 LTS, v8, v9\nYarn v1.2.1+, installation instructions at https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install\ngit, GitHub account\n\nGetting started\nThe first step to start developing neutrino-dev is\nforking the repository to your own GitHub account.\nFork mozilla-neutrino/neutrino-dev on GitHub\nOnce that is done, you can clone your copy of the repository on your computer, replacing USER with the username\nof the account you forked the repository to:\n❯ git clone git@github.com:USER/neutrino-dev.git\n❯ cd neutrino-dev\n\nUpon cloning, you should install dependencies:\n❯ yarn\n\nThis uses the yarn workspaces feature to create symlinks between the various packages, simplifying local development.\nDevelopment commands\nThe package.json for neutrino-dev defines several commands to assist in the development and deployment process.\n\nlink:all\nRuns yarn link against all packages in the neutrino-dev monorepo. This allows you to run yarn link \nanywhere on your system for neutrino-dev packages, making testing of the packages simpler in local projects.\n❯ yarn link:all\n\n# Elsewhere on your system\n❯ yarn link @neutrinojs/react\n\n\nchangelog\nGenerates a changelog for the mozilla-neutrino/neutrino-dev GitHub repository. This changelog is output to a\nCHANGELOG.md file in the root of the repository.\n❯ yarn changelog\n\n\ndocs:serve\nStarts a local development server which builds the documentation in docs to a gitbook running on port 4000.\n❯ yarn docs:serve\n\n\ndocs:build\nGenerates a static site by building the documentation in docs to a gitbook to the _book directory.\n❯ yarn docs:build\n\n\ndocs:deploy\nGenerates a static site by building the documentation in docs to a gitbook to the _book directory, then pushing the\ncontents of _book to a gh-pages branch on GitHub. In order to run this command, you must have an upstream remote\nconfigured pointing to the root neutrino-dev repo, and have sufficient rights to push to the repository.\n❯ yarn docs:deploy\n\nMaking changes\nWhen you make changes to neutrino-dev, you should make them in a branch separate from master. Start from the\nmaster branch and create a new branch for your changes.\nExample: You want to create a core preset for JavaScript Standard Style. You need a new branch for this work.\n❯ git checkout -b standard-style\nSwitched to a new branch 'standard-style'\n\nWhile making changes, be sure to test your code out for expected operation. If possible or applicable, write a\ntest that can verify these changes in the future.\nSubmitting a pull request\nOnce you are satisfied with your changes, you should commit them and submit a pull request. Use git add\nin order to add files that should be committed. Give your changes a descriptive but not overly verbose message.\n❯ git add .\n❯ git commit -m \"Feature: Adding new core preset for JavaScript Standard Style\"\n❯ git push origin standard-style\n\nNow if you open the GitHub page for your repository, GitHub should display a button to open a pull request for\nthe branch and commit you just pushed.
